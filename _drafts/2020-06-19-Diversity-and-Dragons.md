So, for the three people on the planet who haven't noticed, the subject of race has been in the news recently. The proximate cause was a video surfacing in which an handcuffed black man is gleefully choked to death by a Minneapolis police officer over the course of ten minutes as other police officers try to keep away the public. This sparked local protests about the murder, which rapidly grew to nationwide protests about the clusterfuck that is United States's brutal, racist and corrupt policing culture, and then global (or at least European) protests about racism generally.

And so that I've set out my position on the larger issues early on: racism is a bad thing. Less racism sounds great. While the situation in the UK is not as bad as in the US* that's not a high bar to pass, and there's a lot of room for improvement on the topic of race.

*Seriously - the headline stat is obviously the number of african-american deaths in police custody, and it's horrifying, but the stats for white deaths in US police custody are still not something any developed country should consider acceptable.

Anyway this isn't really a blog about racial politics, except in as far as it intersects with D&D, I just thought a bit of context might be useful to set the stage upon which Wizards of the Coast published a statement on [Diversity and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/diversity-and-dnd).

The gist of the statement is:

* We want to portray Orcs and Drow in less monstrous light because some real-world racists portray the people they're racist towards in the same way.
* Our newest books are how we want to write this stuff going forward
* We're reprinting some older stuff to make it less racist.
* We're mucking around with racial modifiers to ability scores
* One of the things we're reprinting is _Curse of Strahd_ because of how it portrays the Vistani.

### The Vistani

Last thing's first, I've only ever skim read _Curse of Strahd_, but I get the problem. For context, the Vistani are basically a fantasy version of the Romani, portrayed with all the care and sensitivity you might expect from a mid-eighties fantasy work.

The original Ravenloft module draws heavily on elements from from the original Dracula novel, including the presence of 'gypsies'. In English, gypsies is a generic, vaguely derogatory term used for both Romani and Pavees/Irish Travellers (on the basis that neither group is from Egypt). In _Dracula_, the titular character's escape from London is transported and protected by gypsies who the protagonists ruthlessly dispatch.

I mention this simply because Bram Stoker (the author of _Dracula_) was Irish, never visited Eastern Europe prior to writing the novel, and seemed to characterise his gypsies as Pavees rather than Romani, but more recent adaptations have settled on the portrayal of them as Romani, because it makes more sense given where they're encountered, and if I'm feeling cynical, I suspect because there are also Romanians in the novel, and I've met more than a few people who didn't realise that they're two different things.

But this extended digression aside, yeah, I can completely see why Wizards want to redo the way the Vistani are characterised, and I'm a bit surprised that _Curse of Strahd_ made it past the editors in 2016 the way it is.

### Racial stats

Continuing in reverse order, I'm not particularly a fan of the idea of mucking around with (and implicitly, removing) the racial ability scores, for a number of reasons. From a mechanical perspective they serve an important role in balancing out the powerful-but-situational advantages provided by things like breath attacks, darkvision and elemental resistances.

They also provide an important link between the fluff of, for example, dwarves as being of powerful and hardy frame, and their actual tabletop performance, or of elves as being nimble, or so on. I accept that some players might want to build a character who is a nimble dwarf, or a muscular elf, and there's nothing stopping them, but conceptually it makes sense to me that particular species are more predisposed to being one thing or another.

I might be barking up the wrong tree here, but I can't help but feel that part of the problem is the overloaded use of the word 'race' in this context. And I suspect that part of that is due to the language divide between British English and American English.

In American English, the word "race" is commonly used to refer to humans of different ethnicities, but its usage in that context is much less in modern British English, and while D&D is American, the fantasy genre draws on a lot of British sources. In the same context, in modern British English, we tend to talk about ethnicities when we're talking about real people.

Regardless, the usage in a fantasy context isn't really the same as the usage as in realworld context - elves, dwarves and gnomes aren't the same species, and dragonborn aren't necessarily even mammals.

The other part of the problem on the D&D side of things is that Rules-As-Written, picking a race comes with things that are clearly cultural rather than biological, notably language proficiencies (and in previous editions, weapon proficiencies - probably to preempt this discussion, in 5e I think all the weapon proficiencies sit on subraces) or stat boosts that are implied to be the result of particular upbringings, as in the case of Tieflings and Half-Elves.

This is one of those design assumptions where something seems to have been copied from the Lord of the Rings, without really understanding the underlying context of it, with the players being a DIY Fellowship of the Ring.

In the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship is a party of an elf, a dwarf, four hobbits, two humans and a wizard (who in Tolkien's setting is essentially a minor deity in disguise), representing five nations - we're not counting Gandalf, because there aren't enough Istarii to count as a nation.

Among the five nations, there are three languages in use, because Hobbits from the Shire, Dunedain and Gondorians all natively speak Westron (aka Common) because all three are historically part of of the Númenórean Realms in Exile, Arnor and Gondor. The Kingdom of Mirkwood is relatively insular, and natively speaks a dialect of elvish, but as a child of nobility, Legolas is expected to know several languages, including Westron, which serves as the lingua franca thanks to Mirkwood's position as an enclave inside the historical borders of Arnor. The story with Gimili is similar - he's the son of a high status figure, effectively an ambassador, and expected to know the trade languages of everybody he might reasonably encounter, in addition to his native dwarvish.

In context then, the split of languages and peoples is fairly logical - we could talk all day about why even the most substantial metropole we see are remarkably non-cosmopolitan, but ultimately this is the world we see through the characters we're given, the point is that the languages the fellowship speak are correlated with their species because of specific worldbuilding. Older settings often assume similarly species-specific nations, but in Tolkien it is fairly clear that the languages are a function of nation of origin, not species. More modern D&D settings tend to assume much more cosmopolitan settings, and there the species/language relationship should be more fluid - you'd expect to see dwarves that natively speak elven, or vice versa.

Where I think this goes sideways right out of the gate is weapon proficiencies. The fellowship are absolutely archetypal in this regard - Legolas the elf uses bows but no armour, Gimili the dwarf uses axes and heavy armour. Aragorn the human ranger uses a bow and a sword with equal skill, Boromir the human knight wields a sword and shield, and wears travelling armour. And the hobbits use slings and later daggers quite effectively.

Does the oddity stand out to you? Aragorn, Boromir and Gimili are all classic warrior nobility, trained and equipped according to the highest standards of their respective nations. Aragon's people at this point are semi-nomadic at this point, and bows are essential if you expect to have to hunt your own food, while a sword is a staple backup weapon and an important symbol of rank (partly _because_ they're only a weapon, not a tool). Favouring heavy infantry is a common tactic for powerful city-states to leverage their greater industrial capacity against less urban neighbours, and Boromir of Gondor and Gimili of Erebor both fill that role to varying degrees. While Legolas's predominantly ranged focus might seem like the oddity, I'd argue it isn't, particularly. Favouring archery over swordsmanship may not entirely fit with the image of the chivalrous noble, but it's an extremely effective weapon, and one that works well for a numerically inferior city state who can make use of defence in depth, but absolutely cannot absorb heavy casualties.

The oddity is the hobbits. All of them are civilians, and more than that, they're
