So, for the three people on the planet who haven't noticed, the subject of race has been in the news recently. The proximate cause was a video surfacing in which an handcuffed black man is gleefuly choked to death by a Minneapolis police officer over the course of ten minutes as other police officers try to keep away the public. This sparked local protests about the murder, which rapidly grew to nationwide protests about the clusterfuck that is United States's brutal, racist and corrupt policing culture, and then global (or at least European) protests about racism generally.

And so that I've set out my position on the larger issues early on: racism is a bad thing. Less racism sounds great. While the situation in the UK is not as bad as in the US* that's not a high bar to pass, and there's a lot of room for improvement on the topic of race.

*Seriously - the headline stat is obviously the number of african-american deaths in police custody, and it's horrifying, but the stats for white deaths in US police custody are still not something any developed country should consider acceptable.

Anyway this isn't really a blog about racial politics, except in as far as it intersects with D&D, I just thought a bit of context might be useful to set the stage upon which Wizards of the Coast published a statement on [Diversity and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/diversity-and-dnd).

The gist of the statement is:

* We want to portray Orcs and Drow in less monsterous light because some real-world racists portray the people they're racist towards in the same way.
* Our newest books are how we want to write this stuff going forward
* We're reprinting some older stuff to make it less racist.
* We're mucking around with racial modifiers to ability scores
* One of the things we're reprinting is _Curse of Strahd_ because of how it portrays the Vistani.

### The Vistani

Last thing's first, I've only ever skim read _Curse of Strahd_, but I get the problem. For context, the Vistani are basically a fantasy version of the Romani, portrayed with all the care and sensitivity you might expect from a mid-eighties fantasy work.

The original Ravenloft module draws heavily on elements from from the original Dracula novel, including the presence of 'gypsies'. In English, gypsies is a generic, vaguely derogatory term used for both Romani and Pavees/Irish Travellers (on the basis that neither group is from Egypt). In _Dracula_, the titular character's escape from London is transported and protected by gypsies who the protagonists ruthlessly dispatch.

I mention this simply because Bram Stoker (the author of _Dracula_) was Irish, never visited Eastern Europe prior to writing the novel, and seemed to characterise his gypsies as Pavees rather than Romani, but more recent adaptations have settled on the portrayal of them as Romani, because it makes more sense given where they're encountered, and if I'm feeling cynical, I suspect because there are also Romanians in the novel, and I've met more than a few people who didn't realise that they're two different things.

But this extended digression aside, yeah, I can completely see why Wizards want to redo the way the Vistani are characterised, and I'm a bit surprised that _Curse of Strahd_ made it past the editors in 2016 the way it is.

### Racial stats

Continuing in reverse order, I'm not particularly a fan of the idea of mucking around with (and implictly, removing) the racial ability scores, for a number of reasons. From a mechanical perspective they serve an important role in balancing out the powerful-but-situational advantages provided by things like breath attacks, darkvision and elemental resistances.

They also provide an important link between the fluff of, for example, dwarves as being of powerful and hardy frame, and their actual tabletop performance, or of elves as being nimble, or so on. I accept that some players might want to build a character who is a nimble dwarf, or a muscular elf, and there's nothing stopping them, but conceptually it makes sense to me that particular species are more predisposed to being one thing or another. Similarly, 

I might be barking up the wrong tree here, but I can't help but feel that part of the problem is the overloaded use of the word 'race' in this context. And I suspect that part of that is due to the language divide between British English and American English.

In American English, the word "race" is commonly used to refer to humans of different ethnicities, but its usage in that context is much less in modern British English, and while D&D is American, the fantasy genre draws on a lot of British sources. In the same context, in British English, we tend to talk about ethnicities when we're talking about real people.

Regardless, the usage in a fantasy context isn't really the same as the usage as in realworld context - elves, dwarves and gnomes aren't the same species, and dragonborn aren't necessarily even mammals.

The other part of the problem on the D&D side of things is that Rules-As-Written, picking a race comes with things that are clearly cultural rather than biological, notably language proficencies (and in previous editions, weapon proficiencies - probably to preempt this discussion, in 5e I think all the weapon proficiencies sit on subraces) or stat boosts that are implied to be the result of particular upbringings, as in the case of Tieflings and Half-Elves.

This is one of those design assumptions where something seems to have been copied from the Lord of the Rings, without really understanding the underlying context of it, with the players being a DIY Fellowship of the Ring.

In the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship is a party of an elf, a dwarf, four hobbits, two humans and a wizard (who in Tolkien's setting is essentially a minor deity in disguise), representing five nations - we're not counting Gandalf, because there aren't enough Istarii to count as a nation.

Among the five nations, there are three languages in use, because Hobbits from the Shire, Dunedain and Gondorians all natively speak Westron (aka Common) because all three are
