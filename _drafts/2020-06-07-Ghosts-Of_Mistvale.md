One of my hobbies is playing tabletop RPGs, which if I want to play a campaign with other people, tends to mean D&D. The group I currently play with I've played with before, and the core of the group has been playing one-shot RPGs together before that for years.

Right now, we're playing Ghosts of Mistvale, with me as the DM. I'm running essentially the campaign from the Ghosts of Saltmarsh books, albeit heavily modified to fit into the campaign setting we're using. I plan to make a series of posts about the campaign, describing how I've adapted the book to this setting and these characters, but I thought I'd start with the basic overview of the campaign setting.

The primary setting is the continent of Vanaheim, created by Shaun, the DM of the previous D&D campaign we played, while Mistvale is a smaller region to the north of that continent I created as the homeland of my character in that campaign. Ghosts of Mistvale is set in the southern portion of Mistvale, with Saltmarsh taking the role of the first civilized port north of the Barrier Mountains.

One of Shaun's original tenets for Vanaheim is that no good global maps exist of the continent as a whole, and the field of cartography in general is in a pretty sorry state, as a result of both pervasive magic and political suppression. The only extent map of the setting, to my knowledge, is the one I made while playing in the first campaign, based on the approximate travel times, and that rapidly became less accurate as the party gained access to the nexus gates - a teleportation system with endpoints in most of the major cities of the continent.

Based on that map, the continent is approximately the same size and shape as Australia, and contains six major nation states: Cyloquil, occupying the south east and centre of the continent, the Lost Forest, occupying the western northwest, Rhodan in the north, Mistvale in the northeast, and T'Scarr in the south-east, and the Great Drake Isles occupying the south, off the body of the main continent.

A mountain range divides the continent in two, beginning in the heart of the Lost Forest, and growing steadily until it reaches the ocean to the south of Mistvale, with a handful of major passes. A cataclysmic impact in the distant past has left an enormous gorge called the Scar, from which T'Scarr takes its name, separating the majority of that nation from the body of Cyloquil. The ejacta from that impact, combined with a smaller existing mountain range to create a near impassible barrier between Rhodan and Mistvale.
