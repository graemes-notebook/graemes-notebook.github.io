The Culture is the name of a series of science fiction books written by Iain M. Banks. I'm a massive fan, and I got into the books a couple of years after he died, so the saubreddit for the books was still quite active, and answering questions on there was what got me into the site in the first place. Most of these answers are therefore seven or eight years old, although since there have been no new books in the time, and the rumoured Amazon adaptation of Consider Phlebas has, perhaps fortunately, disappeared back into development hell, they haven't been invalidated by newer canon.

The series follows the titular Culture, a utopian civilisation living in post-scacity conditions aboard a mix of Orbitals and other space habitats, as they deal with the various moral dilemmas and social crises that arise over the roughly thousandish year period the novels cover. The Culture is made of a mix of organic and inorganic citizens, in theory perfectly equal, although the practical implementation of this are sometimes the subject of plot. Ships and large installations like Orbitals are operated by the Minds, superintelligent, post-singularity AI, and inhabited by panhumans, (an assortment of mostly humanish species, with an assortment of genetically-engineered improvements and compatibility patches) and Drones, loosely panhuman-equivalent AI inhabiting a single body, usually a floating using forcefield technology, and ranging inside from a ping-pong ball upwards. Just to confuse matters, Minds often use directly controlled drones (lower-case) to accomplish things, and have humanoid avatars that range from "clearly the Terminator" through to "human with a chip in their brain" levels of obviousness.

There's some terminology used below that isn't necessarily obvious from context, which I'll explain here as a glossary:

*Contact* -- A subculture in the Culture that specialises in interacting with other civilisations, particularly those that are not peer civilisations in some respect. Think Starfleet, except less miltary and more hippie.

*Culturenik* -- A person from the Culture, organic or otherwise. Sometimes spelled culturnik

*Equiv-tech* -- A civilisation of equivalent technological capability.

*Hegemonising Swarm* -- something that turns what it encounters into copies of itself. Usually stereotypical self-replicating robots, but not always.

*Involved* -- Spacefaring civilisations that interact with the rest of the galaxy. 

*Special Circumstances* -- The Culture's ad-hoc intelligence services. 

*GSV, MSV, LSV, GCU, GCV, GOU, ROU, LOU, FP and VFP* -- Ship classes, SV are Systems Vehicles (civilian vessels), OU are Offensive Units (warships). G-prefix stands for General, and means capital ships, M is Medium, L is Limited. R is Rapid, as in "rapid reaction force". FP and VFP are Fast and Very Fast Pickets, (allegedly) demilitarised OUs used mainly as couriers. GCV and GCU are ships designed for working with Contact (They are usually small and less superficially threatening than GSVs, while also being well-able to take care of themselves). SV classes are usually geological features, with the size of the feature indicating the relative size of the class, for example an Ocean-Class GSV is smaller than a Plate-Class GSV, and both are bigger than a Mountain-Class GCU. The Culture doesn't like the idea of warships, so their class names tend to be things like Gangster-Class, Thug-Class, and Murderer-Class.

## Why don't old Drones have their AI cores put into smaller bodies?

There's a couple of aspects to this:

Firstly, in the novels you usually only ever find out the age of Drones because they have unusually large bodies, or have decided against particular upgrades (Jase, in Consider Phlebas chose not to have aura fields fitted). There are probably plenty of Drones whose age is never remarked on precisely because they have upgraded to smaller, modern bodies and therefore don't stand out as being old. Much like for the biological culture citizens, looking old is a choice, not an inevitability.

Secondly, a cylinder or slab 150cm high and 50cm in diameter/width/depth isn't that big. Even if you allow 20cm or so extra to account for hovering, that's still basically the same the same size as a basic human. Culture technology is pretty forgiving of unusual body proportions. Kabe Ischloear in Look to Windward is a three metre tall pyramid, but he still seems to function without too much difficulty (I believe a shuttle has to morph a couple of couches at one point to accommodate him, but that's about it). Human-sized and able to hover doesn't seem particularly cumbersome.

Finally, there's no real reason to assume that the older looking Drones haven't been upgraded internally -- it's explictly stated that Jase could have had aura fields fitted if they wanted. If I were an old Drone with a distinctive and larger-than-usual body, I'd keep the outer shell, but have my internals updated, and used the freed up space for more computing power, better/more field generators, or whatever else I might feel is lacking.

## At the time of Consider Phlebas, the Culture's population was stated to be 18 trillion. In blog post Banks once said the Culture's population is 30 trillion. does that population growth seem plausible given their stated age of 9000 years?

Firstly, see all the other answers to this question, since they sound accurate.

Secondly, I haven't found the blog post you're referring to, but I'm assuming that the 30 trillion population is Player of Games-era Culture. The first timeline I could find put the events of Consider Phlebas in the 1330s, and Player of Games in the 2080s, so about 750 years difference. That's about two generations.

Doing some extremely naive calculation:

If the average Culture citizen has 1.2 children (ie their half of the stereotypical family of 2.4 children), Generation 0 of 18T citizens will produce a Generation 1 of 21.6T, who in turn will produce a Generation 2 of 25.9T. And by Generation 3 we will have passed the magic 30T and reached 31.1T.

Now, if we were talking about baseline humans, living in first world conditions, going from 18T to 80T is trivial -- the rate of population growth in the UK over the last 10 years has hovered around 0.7%. At that rate, starting with 18T people, it would take just under 73 years for the population to grow to 30T.

Unfortunately, we don't know what the Culture's population growth is, although we can probably assume it's lower. The Culture certainly could grow that fast, but the general trend is better standard of living, lower growth rate. If the Culture really wanted to go for broke, they could pump out Drone citizens at arbitarily fast rates, but they'd be treading dangerously close to Hegemonising Swarm territory then. Anyway, I tried various ways to come up with a ballpark figure for population growth, without much success. This next bit is therefore largely guesswork:

We know the Culture generally crews new ships with excess population of their parent ship. This is described in Use of Weapons, where the GCU Sweet and Full of Grace is built by the population of the GSV Size Isn't Everything. Unfortunately neither ship's class is mentioned, and the GSV is implied to be a throughput ship, so these numbers are completely speculative (although if it is a throughput ship, that implies it has a higher growth rate than the Culture as a whole).

Google gives the population of a Plate-class GSV as being about 460 million, and State of the Art gives the crew count of an Escarpment-class GCU as being 300. This is backed up by Excession, which says the GCU Grey Area was built for 300. This is probably at the lower end of standard for a "normal" GCU (based on the size of an geological escarpment to a ridge or a mountain, which both have corresponding GCU classes).

Use of Weapons says Zalakwe spent a couple of years on Size Isn't Everything, and implies that Sweet and Full of Grace was built over the same period (I'm calling it three years). Assuming the surplus population was acquired over the same period, that's a growth rate of 0.000021%. At that rate, it would take 2.4 million years for the population to grow to 30T from 18T.

This brings us, by a very circuitous route, back to where we started: either the figures stated aren't raw population growth, or my numbers are complete nonsense. Either is plausible.

Minor aside: if the population growth rate is 0.07% (1/10th of the UK's rate) then you get your 12T citizens over about 730 years.

_There were two comments in the discussion I responded to, the first drew attention to the idea a lot of culture citizens tend have two children, they father one and give birth to one. I agreed, expanding:_

Which means for the purposes of the statistics, every culture citizen is female and gives birth to one child.

The actual number of children per Culturnik won't be exactly one though. Some Culturniks do give birth to more than one child (Lededje Y'breq in the epilogue of Surface Detail has more than one) and some will die childless.

Given that the Culture is growing, the average will be slightly more than one, but a lot less than two. Figuring out what that number actually is is pretty much guesswork though.

_The other comment sparked a bit more discussion. I'm including the comment in full, partly for ego-boosting purposes:_

Great writing!

> but they'd be treading dangerously close to Hegemonising Swarm territory then

I don't know, swarms are stupid. But yeah, they could push out any amount of drones they like. If we are about it, they could push out organics too at almost the same rate. You don't have to be conceived by two other organics to come into the world.

_My reply was:_

I'm not convinced that swarms are necessarily stupid. The GSV Sleeper Service deliberately neuters its fleet by giving them AI cores rather than full on Minds specificially to avoid being thought of as a hegemonic threat by the rest of the culture.

You're right, the organic birthrate could be far higher as well. Even without growing Culturniks in vats, convention seems to be the only limiting factor on childbirth. Culturniks are healthy and fertile pretty much their entire, multi-century lifespan. Assuming normal human gestation periods, hundreds of children per citizen is theoretically possible. It's just that if they started doing that, they'd stop being the Culture that we know and love.

## What is the difference between a ship's drone and a ship's avatar, beyond physical appearance?

I'm assuming you use ships drone to mean a drone controlled by the ship Mind, and a ship's avatar to mean the humanoid avatars? Particularly in the earlier books, Banks uses the two terms interchangably to refer to drones controlled by a ship Mind, and in those cases there's no distinction, and the difference in terminology is to seperate a drone controlled by the ship from a Drone controlled by its own individual sentience.

In general, Minds hosting large populations (such as the GSV Sense Amid Madness, Wit Amidst Folly and Masaq Orbital) have lots of both, it's only the ships that have much smaller populations (or even no population at all) that have one or the other.

Generally, the avatars seem to be favoured by ships with no crew, and which expect to have business elsewhere -- the GOU Falling Outside Normal Constraints, Superlifter/GCU Liveware Problem and Ue Mistake Not... are all crewless, and favour avatars which seem to spend a lot of their time either planetside or hanging out on larger ships. They all operate in _circumstances_ which are somewhat _special_, which may also be a factor.

The GCU Bodhisattva OAQS doesn't have a crew, but as a Quietus ship, doesn't really deal with other people very much, and so sticks to low-effort drones on the infrequent occaisons when it needs them. The dROU Xenophobe has a pretty tiny crew, and gets by with the bear-avatar, which seems more like a modified drone than the humanoid avatars we see on other ships. It seems to keep itself occupied with its crew, rather than spending time on GSVs.

For onboard operations, ships don't need either -- one of the ship Major Quilan travels on during Look to Windward doesn't bother with drones or avatars, and just handles everything with fields, leading to the somewhat disconcerting sight of clothes packing and unpacking themselves.

For what it's worth, ship drones seem to be slightly less independent and more utilitarian than ship avatars, but that might just be because avatars seem more relatable to our viewpoint characters. Ultimately, it comes down to the basic maxims of the Culture: nobody will make you do anything if you don't want to, Minds responsible for fewer people tend to be more (small-e) eccentric, and usually the limit on doing what you want is good taste, rather than resources.

## As far as I can recall no one ever actually laughs at ship names, that being the case what's the point of them?

Most ship names aren't the kind of joke you laugh at, they're the kind of thing you read and inwardly smile.

A ship needs to have a name. Even if the ship is officially known by a randomly assigned serial number, the crew onboard will end up giving it a name, because that's how people work. That goes double for ships that are intelligent and chatty.

As for why the names are the style they are, partly I think it's just convention -- Culture ships pick whimisical names, you're a Culture ship and proud to be, why not join the fun?

I imagine the reason it got started is because the Culture doesn't want its first impression to be fear of its martial power -- to paraphrase Terry Pratchett, make people laugh, and they're not afraid. Imagine: A hyper-advanced alien spaceship appears unexpectedly in your solar system at a speed that makes your theoretical physicists tear up their textbooks and whimper in a corner. How would it change your impression of the situation if, instead of introducing itself as "The Fist of God" it introduced itself as the "It's My Party And I'll Sing If I Want To"?

## How might a direct democracy work effectively when people can duplicate their minds endlessly?

I imagine the rules probably vary depending on the scope of the referendum -- a referendum limited to the thirty-being crew of a torturer-class ROU has different needs to a referendum concerning somewhere like Masaq. The fact that Look to Windward mentions the arguments about franchise suggests there's not a universal process for deciding how the referenda work.

For duplicates of a single person who are divergent enough (by whatever metric you want to use) to be considered distinct individuals, I'd argue that they should be able to vote normally -- the limiting factor there is the Culture's general policy that duplicating yourself unnecessarily is tacky.

In any referendum with any kind of voter registration involved (even if voter registration consists of Voter List = Current Census) there's a certain element of Mutually Assured Destruction involved -- duplicating yourself enough times to shift the balance of an election isn't something you can do unnoticed, and if one side can duplicate themselves, so can the other.

I can't remember how duplicating yourself works -- if it's a Mind- or Ship-assisted process, then there's no guarantee that you'll be able to duplicate yourself at all, let alone enough times to matter. The local Mind is under no obligation to help you make a mockery of the vote.

And of course, there's the Culture's ultimate sanction: reputation. The local Mind has no incentive to let you skew the vote because it will lose face amongst its peers. And it's not like the modern day where any major election has to be final because it's such a huge undertaking. If the vote is suspect, it can easily be rerun. For you personally, there could be pretty severe social consequences once it gets out that you tried to disenfranchise everybody else. Get used to your own company, because nobody except your duplicates will be inviting you to their parties for quite a while...

## In The Player of Games, What was the Culture's motives and why would they have this master plan to bring down the Azad Empire through such a multilayered and prolonged scheme?

You ask to what end the Culture would want to topple the Empire of Azad, but take a look at the conditions most of the citizens of the empire live in. Their fates and fortunes are dictated by a game most of them have no chance of ever mastering, the empire's rule is pretty brutal, and its apparently more or less a feudal system long after becoming spacefaring.

A civilisation like that is abhorrent to the Culture, and while they could just leave the Empire be, it's still expansionist, so the problems are only going to spread, and right now, the Empire is still small enough and cohesive enough that the Culture can keep whatever intervention they make fairly unobtrusive.

As to why the plan is so multilayered, it's a combination of deniability and minimizing collateral damage -- the toppling of the empire is achieved with a single ship, a single drone, and a single culturnik, the damage is mostly concentrated on the Empire's inner circle, and because the rest of the infrastructure of the empire is reasonably intact, the Culture's "ambassador" on Azad will find it pretty easy to bring about the social changes the Culture wants without too many more deaths.

If the Culture didn't care about either, they could have achieved the same results with (from their perspective) trivial amounts of brute force, but that's not how they try to operate.

## If the Culture is a post scarcity society, how do people actually GET what they want? If I wanted something like a new car or a throne made out of gold and gems what's the process behind its creation to my possession?

They ask Hub (on an Orbital, or the Ship) for it.

In the opening of player of games, there's a discussion about getting a new game board versus playing with the house set, where it would take a little while for a drone to fly them a new board. I'd guess that's how it works on most of the Orbitals for anything not massively urgent -- Hub manufactures things it thinks it might need using the same factories it uses to build everything else (I imagine these are located on the side of the Orbital that's exposed to space) and then transported to stockpiles stored close to where it predicts it will need them, then when somebody requests something, it's either delivered by one of the Hub's drones, if it's small, or displaced to where it's needed if it's too large for that.

If you want something custom, it would follow the same basic process -- being manufacturered and delivered. In the specific case of a new car though, why? There isn't an extensive road network, most travel on an Orbital is using the pods on the outside, or using small hub-controlled flyers for shorter journeys. And on a ship, you don't even need that.

The only reason to have a car is as a hobby, in which case, you're a highly educated Culture citizen with nothing but time on your hands, why wouldn't you build it yourself? The social prestige of doing that would mean you'd be invited to far more parties than if you just drove something Hub had made for you.

I'm thinking that the concept of a consumer good probably looks very different in the Culture. With pretty much everything manufactured perfectly by the Minds and available on request, the concept of brands (which is clearly a big deal in modern day car ownership) probably doesn't really exist.

Obviously you get goods that have a certain cachet because they have a non-Mind creator of some note; Mahrai Ziller and his symphonies springs to mind. I suppose there's probably a physical equivalent with hand-made goods made by skilled craftsmen, but without the impetus of an economic need to create, the majority of their output will be for its own sake, and is likely to stay within creator's social circle.

_Actually, there's probably hubs that do have proper road networks, but only because the inhabitants think that they'd be fun to drive on, in which case, you've also got a community presumably building cars to drive on them..._

## How old you have to be to vote as a Culture citizen?

I imagine the voting age is "when they're interested enough to bother". Culture birthrates are low enough that young children are rarely going to be a major demographic except on votes that directly affect them.

Culturniks are generally considered adults when they look and act like it -- different groups have different measures, age is a common one, as is choosing a personal name. But there isn't going to be much that has a hard age barrier or anything, because everybody is different, even more so than for humans.

## Could an Orbital/Ringworld/Halo world (inspired by IMB apparently) really exist? Or do the physics rule it out?

It's not an easy question to answer. They're not all the same structure, for one thing, although they are superficially similar.

Ringworlds are much larger than either Halo Installations or Orbitals. They're more like a segment of a solid dyson sphere. They have all kinds of physics issues -- keeping it in the proper orbit of the star, stopping the surface from being burned to a crisp due to lack of a day/night cycle, etc. They're probably not possible with real world science, and definitely not practical.

Halos and orbitals are similiar in size to each other -- they have diameters on the order of magitude of a gas giant, and orbit a star like a planet would. Halos are solid rings -- they're made of some unknown metal in the games, but its properties probably aren't too outlandish -- you might be able to use steel, based on the back-of-the-envelope calculations on wikipedia, and the quantities required are within the realms of feasibility (it would need most of the iron in the asteroid belt, which is at least theoretically attainable). There are all kinds of problems with sustaining an ecosystem on something like that, but if you can build something this massive, you probably have the scientific knowledge to engineer lifeforms that could tolerate it.

Orbitals aren't a single solid structure -- they're made of separate plates, held together by using the Cultures's ubiquitous field technology. Since we don't know how that works, and can't even come up with any plausible theories, that probably puts it out of the realms of real physics. But other than that, orbitals are probably more practical than Halos, as they don't require the solid ring to be built first -- one of the novels mentions that orbitals can be started with just three small plates, and then more can be added at a later date as needed. Because the plates themselves aren't loadbearing, they can be made of pretty much anything, so the asteroid fields of whatever star system you're building it in can provide plenty of material to work with.

TL;DR Maybe.

## (In reference to a society encountered by Zakalwe in Use of Weapons) Do you think it's plausible that society could have steam power before guns? 

It's very plausible that a society could develop steam power before firearms.

On Earth, the earliest things we could call guns were developed in China in about 1000 AD. The first practical steam engine was invented in the 1600s, but the first known example of a steam engine is the Aeopile, which written about in the 1st century AD. It was a physics toy, but there are also designs for using steam power to open temple doors, so even if it was purely theoretical, the idea of steam power wasn't totally unthinkable.

The reason guns spread and developed faster is probably because of their theoretical simplicy. Once you can make gunpowder, further development is quite easy. Refining a steam engine beyond the most basic practical design is an expensive and complicated process. It needs a sophisticated understanding of metallurgy (which in turn requires a fair amount of infrastructure) and a fairly good grasp of the theory.

The important part of that paragraph for your question was "once you can make gunpowder". Gunpowder needs access to sulphur and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The main source of sulphur pre-industrial-chemistry is volcanoes -- if the planet Zakalwe is sent to doesn't have significant volcanic activity (either at all, or just near to where the dominant civilisation developed) then they're not going to have access to suphur (and thus gunpowder) until much later in their history. The same restriction applies to potassium nitrate -- the main non-synthesised source is bat guano, if their bird analogues have different body chemistry...

There are other explosives, of course, so it's quite possible that they could develop guns using a different propellant, but most of the ones I can think of either need reasonably advanced chemistry or have other properties that make them unsuitable for firearms. The issue isn't so much if firearms can be developed at all, but whether or not they can be made practical -- if all the ingredients have to be synthesised, that's going to significantly delay their introduction, at least until their industrial revolution.

So, in summary: Yes, it's definitely possible, it sort-of-almost-nearly-kinda happened on Earth, depending on where you draw the lines for having steam power and guns, and it's mostly an accident of history the way it developed in the order it did.

_Somebody posted this as a TL;DR, and I thought it accurate:_

_Tl;dr: steam is a simple idea that relies on metallurgy, guns are a simple idea that relies on chemicals, therefore their discovery and widespread usage is quite independent of each other._

## Why does the Culture still have humans in it?

If I'm being nitpicky, technically it doesn't have actual humans in it until sometime between the 24th and 29th centuries. The biological citizens are a mongrel mix of loads of different species plus some genetic engineering, which we lump together as panhumans to distinguish them from other, more distinct species. That said, I'm going to call the biological citizens of the Culture humans for the rest of this comment, so judge the value of this nitpick accordingly...

The way I understand it, the moral and ethical core of the Culture came into being before the modern Mind did. We know from Hydrogen Sonata that the Culture formed from a group of six or seven humanoid (and therefore presumably biological) species that were already spacefaring. And we know that older Culture starships (like the one mentioned in Excession) had AI that weren't Minds.

This means that the first Minds (by which I mean 'self-upgrading, significantly-superhuman sentient AI') were 'born' in the Culture (or proto-Culture), into a society that was moral, collectivist and welcoming of AI citizens. The newborn Minds are raised in this civilisation, and for the most part adopt its value system as their own. These Minds then bootstrap themselves to the kinds of intelligence we see in modern Minds, but retain the same ethical values as their parent civilisation. Essentially, the proto-culture had values along the lines of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" except now the Mind citizens abilities far outstrip the needs of their biological fellows, to the point that not only do no humans need to work, most Minds don't either (although in practice how that falls out is that most Minds do work, just using a tiny fraction of their concentration, because they're capable of massively parallel activity in a way biological beings aren't).

At that point, you have the modern Culture, more or less. The mundane duties needed to maintain a civilisation have transferred the Minds, who in turn have transferred them to non-sentient subsystems that mostly maintain themselves. From the Minds' point of view, the human citizens are as much a part of the Culture as they are, they're just less able members.

Most humans don't get bored with having their wants and needs met. Most people, freed from the need to work to live will quite happily find a purpose for themselves, whether that's creating things, or mastering skills, or immersing themselves in social activities, or anything else. The human parts of Contact are mostly those people whose needs include a need to feel useful in a way that can't be met elsewhere, but even in the main body of the Culture there are still ways to be useful if you want, with different levels of commitment and effort involved.

Now, you can argue that yes, anything you might do to feel useful can be done just as well by a machine, and you'd probably be right, but part of what makes the Culture the Culture and not just another swarm of super-intelligent machines is that it still includes humans even in frontline roles, and that's something a machine can't do. Humans fight and die alongside Minds and drones, (eg hedgeswarm stomping in Surface Detail), explore the universe with them (Contact) and even do the dirty work alongside them (SC). They're partners, not just pets.

Interestingly, we see an advanced civilisation that's relationship between the biological and technological citizens has played out differently. The Napture is a biological species that has ceded it's place on the galactic stage to it's AI counterpart, the Napture Reliquia, and the 'humans' (giant flying foxes) have withdrawn to their homeworld and stopped paying attention to the rest of the galaxy.

## Why wouldn’t older ships just be continually upgraded over the years?

I think the other answers catch the key points*, but another relevant factor is that they absolutely do upgrade -- in the discussion you're referring to, the Torturer-class the Falling Outside the Normal Moral Constraints pretends to be is a "plausibly upgraded" one, outside the original spec of the class.

The reason the mismatch is so severe between the Torturer and Abominator has more to do with the fact the former is an ROU and the latter a GOU, ROUs being a bundle of weapons strapped to an engine, and GOUs being a broad-spectrum fuck-you-and-your-entire-civilisation to everything in the volume.

Basically, the GFCF think they're taking on a Vietnam-era PT boat with a new motor and a new coat of paint, but it's actually a Type-45 Destroyer. (Or, given the nature of the Abominator-class, an entire carrier group.)

_* The other answers basically boiling down to "I don't have to upgrade if I don't want to" and "I can kill a solar system, why do I need more guns?"_
