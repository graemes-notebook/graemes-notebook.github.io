One of my hobbies involves 3D printers, and since it's one of my more explainable ones, when people ask, it's one of my go-to options to talk about. Paticularly a few years ago, when 3D printers were less of a thing, pretty much the first question anybody would ask, after "how does it work?" is "could you 3D print a gun?". I get asked it much less these days, partly I hope because I don't exude so much of a "potential spree-killer" vibe as I used to, and partly because I hope the technology is better understood. That said, when Shinzo Abe was murdered a few months ago, I noted the initial coverage seemed very obsessed with the possibility the gun used was 3D printed (it wasn't) and I was having a conversation with somebody at work the other day and they asked the gun question, which inspired me to write up a fuller explanation of the answer as a blog post.

There's really a few questions here, which will serve as section headers.

## Will you 3D print me a gun?

Absolutely not. It's illegal, for one thing, and I either a) don't like you enough to break the law for you or b) like you too much to want to inflict the problems it will bring on you.

## Is it possible to 3D print a gun?

Yes, but it's a really bad idea. Firstly, most civilised countries frown extremely heavily on amateur gunsmiths making unregistered firearms. Secondly, 3D printing isn't a good manufacturing technique for a gun.

## What's the rant you actually want to go on?

Thank you! Firstly, there's a load of different techniques you can call 3D printing, that work with a load of different materials. At the proper expensive end, there are 3D printers that work in metal, using laser sintering and metal powder (laser sinterers also exist using nylon and the like). Of course you can make a gun out of a 3D printer that works in metal. There are commercially available M1911 replicas made using this technique. The resulting gun will be weaker than a conventionally milled or stamped firearm, making it more prone to catastrophic failure, or bulkier to try and prevent that. It will also be MUCH more expensive. The kind of printers we're talking about here cost Â£30k plus for an entry-level machine, with the most basic feature sets.

When people are getting all panicky about the idea of 3D printed guns, they're not talking about metal printers. They're talking about the bog-standard home 3D printers that you can buy for a couple of hundred pounds. These are mostly fused filament machines, or resin printers, (the former take a big spool of plastic wire, the latter use liquid resin). And realistically they're not talking about resin printers - resin printers do small, high detail parts extremely well, but struggle with large, flat surfaced objects.

People have made 3D printed guns using fused filament printers. The one that caused a load of controvesy ten years ago was the Liberator pistol, made by a man called Cody Wilson. Incidentally his other projects have included a crypto-currency wallet called Dark Wallet, a Patreon clone for the alt-right called Hatreon (seriously...) and being [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Wilson#2018_criminal_case](a registered sex offender). I'm not saying that terrible people can't ever have good ideas, but this is not the track record of somebody with good decision-making skills.

Since then, there have been a number of better-designed attempts to make a printable gun, but most of them hit up against a fundamental limitations of the materials and technology. 3D prints will always be fairly weak on their layer lines, which makes them terrible for any kind of pressure-bearing part, and needs careful designing and orienting for mechanical parts. It's not necessarily completely impossible to work around, if your heart is really set on 3D printing a gun, but for the purposes of fear-mongering around 3D printing, it's enough, especially in light of the second half of the rant.

## 3D printing isn't the only way to make things, and almost any other way would work better.

That's not a question. But it is pretty much the point when it comes to the gun question. I think people who ask it have the erroneous idea that firearms are inherently complicated, but that's really not the case at all. The conceptually simplest gun I can think of is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm#Pipe_guns](pipe shotgun). It consists of two bits of pipe and a nail, where the inner pipe is the same diameter as a shotgun shell. The shell goes in here. The outer pipe is just large enough that the inner pipe can slide in one end, and then the other end is sealed, with the nail through it to act as a firing pin. Then the two are slammed together hard enough to trigger the shell.

That's not some kind of secret, hidden information. They were used extensively during WWII by American and Filipino resistance fighters during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, and any museum covering the period will have a couple on display. They're used extensively in modern gang warfare as we. The police in the UK seize hundreds of them a year.

Maybe you don't consider them real firearms, which is moving the goalposts a bit, but whatever. Zip guns are also common gang weapons, and they're slightly more complicated, they usually have a breechblock, a firing spring, and a primitive trigger mechanism. They also tend to look a bit like cobbled-together garbage, because they usually are -- most of the examples I can find don't look they used any tools more complicated than a screwdriver and wrench.

With fairly basic tools and the knowledge to use them, making a lot of weapons from the era of the second world war is pretty easy - weapons like the Sten gun and the American M3 submachine gun (the Grease Gun) were designed to be produced from sheet metal, and plans are readily available online. Conflicts like the Chechen and Yugoslav Wars in the nineties produced thousands of examples of submachine guns that were craft-produced and further-simplified variants of those designs. And in general, open-bolt submachine guns are absurdly simple, the biggest mechanical challenge is making a reliable magazine, and the biggest technical problems are things like reliable safeties (and honestly, if you're trying to make one, safety clearly isn't a priority for you) and managing recoil.

If you've made it this far, congratulations, you've lasted longer than anybody who has asked this question in real life. There's an assumption I'd like to mention that everybody who has asked has made, and that this post has taken for granted, namely that you can get hold of bullets or shotgun shells. Which is interesting to me, because the production of bullets seems far more of a limiting factor than the gun itself.

But honestly, it's midnight, the subject of non-firearm ballistic weapons is a whole other barrel of terrible ideas, and the research for this post has already probably put me on a terrorist watchlist, so I'm going to call it there.
