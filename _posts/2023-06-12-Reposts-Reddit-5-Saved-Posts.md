Ok, so I'm not entirely sure how this stacks up with terms of service and whatnot, but honestly at this point I'm just trying to avert digital entropy. Still, if you're the author of one of these posts, and want me to take down one of these posts, message me and I will.

That said, here's a selection of my saved posts that I think are too good to lose to a random subreddit purge.

## [Why would a goblin join an adventuring group?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/4ozf5i/why_would_a_goblin_join_an_adventuring_group/)

> "Grish-Gnash don't understand... adventurers is like paradise for goblins! Sure sure, longshanks are weird, but listen... listen!
>
> Longshanks just SHARE FOOD. Someone finds it and offers to everyone. Some cook big feasts! Some make magic boom feasts that fill up stomach for HOURS. HOURS!! No getting hungry minutes later. They just give it to Binky like Binky had fought for it and won it herself! NO lying, NO fighting. JUST FREE FOOD ALL THE TIME.
>
> Then longshanks find shinies and magics and glowy weapons and rings. STILL NO FIGHTING FOR IT! Binky says 'Binky wants that!' and longshanks say "O' course Binky, here Binky goes!"
>
> Binky gets to fight only when Binky is at advantage! The longshanks make plans and send Binky to scout ahead, they wait and cast spells to help. Binky can hide and let them do what they want... Binky can rush in. They say nothing as Binky lights all the other longshanks on fire because adventurers tell Binky they were BAD longshanks, and praise Binky when Binky lights and bite and ignites!!
>
> Binky has free pass everywhere now too! Wherever they go, wherever they get invited, Binky follows along. No guards harassing, no pointy-ears try shooty shoot! shiney clothes BOW TO BINKY and say greetings!
>
> Whole thing elaborate scam, has to be. Adventurers pull fur over other longshanks eyes and Binky get to ride along and enjoy all the prizes that go with, only for fighting in return!"

Why would a goblin join an adventuring group? Why WOULDN'T they? Goblin tribes suck for the individual. A party allows for a goblin to do everything they would've wanted to do, only with more freedom and more reward for it!

How do you get the group to accept you though? Become the adorable mascot or the sad puppy dog.

> "Sometimes longshanks worry hallway trapped or door have spikes, or that something poisoned. So Binky do what Binky do best, and run in yelling at traps and scaring spikes! Sometimes Binky get hit by things and it hurts Binky, but the, HERE'S THE CRAZY CRAZY PART, Party heals Binky up and THANKS BINKY FOR DISARMING TRAPS!"

If your goblin is truly gobliny and foolhardy, reckless, and desperate enough... and you focus that energy all into endeavours that minimize damage for your other members, they'll love you for it.

> "Squishy squishy mage was worrying that big scary scary was gonna charge him and stabby stab before he could make magic boom booms. So Binky says, Binky says 'OY YOU [Goblin words, Goblin Words]!" and runs straight at him, jumps on him, wrings his neck, and lights him on fire! Now big scary scary focusing only on Binky and mage make boom booms go BOOM!"

Totally in character for goblins to draw ALL of the attention to themselves, to make themselves the most despicable target, to make anyone want to kill them simply for existing. Combined with reckless endangerment and you just absorb LOTS of damage that would've gone to squishier targets. If you take the Roll With It feat and pump your Acrobatics score really high, you're looking at essentially having DR equal to your Acro-minus-five + d20 once per round when you're hit with melee.

## [Obnoxious cursed items](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/4q4cz1/obnoxious_cursed_items/)

**Hammer +3, Dwarf Thrower**

When wielded by anyone but a dwarf, this acts as a normal war hammer. Whenever a dwarf tries to wield this hammer in combat, however, it picks him up and hurls him bodily at his opponent, at +3 to hit and for ld12 +3 hp damage (to the dwarf--the opponent takes only 1-4 hp damage); the range is 60'. If the dwarf misses his opponent, he (again the dwarf) takes double the above damage; if his opponent has time to "set" or "ground" a weapon such as a spear or military fork-well, it's not a pretty picture. Incidentally, this hammer is an unusually handsome weapon, featuring the finest work of the elvish master smiths.

**Robe of Blending (Waring 3-speed)**

To all appearances, this is a perfectly ordinary robe. If the clasp is examined closely, however, it will be revealed to be a sliding switch with four setting (including "off"). "Chop" does 2-20 hp damage to the wearer, "mix" does 4-48, and "liquefy" makes me sick just thinking about it.

**Robe of Useless Items**

This robe appears to be a garment of no great value--appearances can deceive, but not in this case. The wearer will notice several odd-shaped patches on the garment, primarily because they chafe in uncomfortable places. Detaching one of these patches causes it to actually become one of the following items:

* A bag containing 1,000 lead pieces;

* A one-inch length of rope;

* One pair of high, hard boots, halfling size;

* A wooden ladder, 25' long, with three rungs;

* Half a pair of safety scissors;

* A string of electrical Christmas tree lights;

* A rubber dagger and a glass shield (matched set);

* A book of exalted deeds, written entirely in Thieves' Cant;

* A pint of sovereign glue (undiluted with oil of slipperiness) in a tightly stoppered unbreakable bottle;

* A treasure map pinpointing the exact location of an immense hoard, relative to "the old oak tree:' "the big rock:' "the woodcutter's shack:' and "the bend in the river" (extraneous details such as the name of the kingdom or the continent are omitted);

* A 25th-century death-ray gun, l00% accurate within 300', that kills anything it hits (batteries not included);

* A letter from Ed McMahon, telling the PCs they may already have won $20 million19

Once removed, a patch can never be replaced on the robe. When enough patches have been removed, the robe becomes very drafty, so it is wise to reserve the patches for emergencies.

## [The (real life) sandbox tree seems like it would be a great idea for an RPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/aqn4of/the_real_life_sandbox_tree_seems_like_it_would_be/)

I’m imagining it in DnD, where it is a strange tree that detonates if a medium or larger creature gets within 10 feet. Adventurers often approach them due to the weapons and armour that can often be found near its trunk. All creatures within 30 feet of a Blast Tree when it expels its seeds must make a DC 10 (or whatever) Dex save or take 1 point of piercing damage as a barb impacts you. Failing a subsequent DC 15 (or whatever) Con save means that the barb burrows into you, and cannot be removed by non-magical means. Constructs automatically succeed this saving throw.

Every time you complete a long rest, make a DC 15 Con save, and tally the results in a similar fashion to death saving throws. For every failure, your AC while not wearing armour increases by 1, and your walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. Those around you may notice that your skin is becoming rougher and more bark-like, and your hair appears more mossy. Every success returns your skin and hair to a more natural tone, and increases your speed by 10 feet, provided that your speed is being reduced by a failure. Accruing three successes before three failures ends the effect and restores your walking speed, although your skin and hair retain their plant-like appearance.

Upon accruing three failures, you complete your transformation into a Blast Tree. Roots grow from your limbs and a trunk will begin to sprout from your abdomen. Your worn and carried equipment is pushed off of you as your trunk grows. You lose the ability to speak, use language, or move. You are also blinded and deafened, but gain Blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. Casting Greater Restoration on the afflicted target removes all effects and returns the target to its original form at all stages of infection.

After one year, your new body matures and sprouts small barbed seeds. You have no mouth and you must scream.

## [How Shit Happens](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bywk9m/a_friendship_tree_emmanuel_macron_gave_to_trump/eqnr8fs/)

In the Beginning, there was The Plan; but The Plan was without form; and man created The Procedure.

Darkness was upon the face of the employees; and they were sore afraid; and they looked upon their supervisors and cried: “It is a crock of dung and stinks to High Heaven!”

And the supervisors spake unto the project supervisors, saying: “It is a bucket of manure and intolerably malodorous.”

And the project administrators spake unto the section managers, saying: “It is a vessel of fertilizer and exceedingly strong.”

And the section managers spake unto the department directors, saying: “It promoteth growth and is very powerful.”

And the department directors spake unto the company president, saying: “It augmenteth development and productivity.”

And the company president looked down on The Procedure and declared: “AND IT WAS GOOD!” And so the Plan became Policy. This is how Shit Happens.

## [Ruins and the emotions they evoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/uekjql/ruins_and_the_emotions_they_evoke/)

...one of my favorite ruins-related discussions is in the talmud (the jewish oral torah - and writings/sayings/commentary collected over the first 500 years CE). 

The talmud is written in a conversational format, often in the context of a debate, and sometimes references itself \[the book\]. ) it can be dense and confusing, and also it goes on very long tangents. it's much less poetic, but deeply human and funny:

The ruins comes up as a *side tangent* on a very long discussion about "from what time do we recite the shema?" which asks things like "what's the difference between nighttime and dusk? when does the day start, or end? how do we know the answer?" and so on. 

so during this conversation we're told a story about a Rabbi who ran into the prophet elijah (who sometimes just...shows up to things, as you do):

>Rabbi Yosei said: I was once walking along the road when I entered the ruins of an old, abandoned building among the ruins of Jerusalem in order to pray. I noticed that Elijah, of blessed memory, came and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance until I finished my prayer.   
>  
>When I finished praying and exited the ruin, Elijah said to me: Greetings to you, my Rabbi.  
>  
> I answered him: Greetings to you, my Rabbi, my teacher.   
>  
>And Elijah said to me: My son, why did you enter this ruin? 

and Yosei says he wanted to avoid being distracted by passerby while praying, to which Elijah says he should've said the shortened version of the prayer that exists for that purpose. And then Yosei explains the things he learned on that day from Elijah, one of them being "one may not enter a ruin."

 Then the talmud explains some more:

>The Sages taught, **for three reasons one may not enter a ruin:**  
>  
>**\[1\] Because of suspicion of licentiousness** \[prostitution, adultery\],   
>  
>**\[2\] because the ruin is liable to collapse,**   
>  
>**\[3\] and because of demons.**   
>  
>Three separate reasons \[for the prohibition on entering ruins\] seem extraneous, so the Gemara \[part of the Talmud\] asks: Why was the reason because of suspicion necessary? Let this law be derived because of \[concerns of\] collapse.  
>  
>The Gemara answers: **This law applies even in the case of a new, sturdy ruin, where there is no danger of collapse.** Therefore, the reason because of suspicion is cited **in order to warn one not to enter a new ruin as well.**

...which, "new, sturdy ruin" makes me laugh every time. but it goes on like this, methodically asking why you need three different reasons to not go wandering around in ruins. why isn't *one good reason* enough?

and to summarize:

* demons are usually only a threat to individuals, not people in pairs or groups, so it wouldn't apply if more than one person went into the ruin
* however -- pairs or groups could be getting up to some funny business, unless they have upstanding reputations, so it really depends on the people in question 
* so why not just say the only concern is suspicion *and* demons?
* well, because two upstanding people entering a ruin aren't suspicious AND they aren't at risk of dealing with demons because there's two of them. obviously!

Then it says this:

>The Gemara considers the third reason, the prohibition against entering ruins is because of demons. Why is it necessary to include: Because of demons? Let the prohibition be derived from suspicion and collapse.   
>  
>The Gemara responds: There are cases where demons are the only concern, for example where it is a new ruin into which two upstanding individuals enter, so there is neither concern lest it collapse nor of suspicion.   
>  
>The Gemara points out, however, that if there are two people, there is also no concern of demons. **As such, the question remains: In what case can demons be the sole cause not to enter a ruin?**
>  
>The Gemara responds: **Generally speaking, two individuals need not be concerned about demons; but, if they are in a place known to be haunted by demons (see Isaiah 13:21), we are concerned about demons even with two people.**

**which is my favorite, because this is a guide to being horror genre savvy.**

**don't go into the ruins because:**

1. people think you're up to no good in there
2. ruins are definitionally structurally unsound and therefore a collapse-risk
3. if those other reasons don't sound convincing, have you considered: that shit's haunted and full of demons?

## [What are some facts about humans that make us sound bad ass?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9dihxq/what_are_some_facts_about_humans_that_make_us/)

We are the only superpredator known to exist. Our best friends are apex predators we allow to live in our homes and treat like children, and we are sufficiently skilled at predation that we have allowed them to give up hunting for survival.

We accidentally killed enough of the biomass on the planet that we are now in the Anthropocene era, an era of earths history that marks post-humanity in geological terms. We are an extinction event significant enough that we will be measurable in millions of years even if we all died tomorrow.

We are the only creature known that engages in group play fighting. Other animals play fight, but not in teams. This allowed us to develop tactics, strategy, and so on, and was instrumental in hunting and eventually war.

We are sufficiently deadly that in order for something to pose a credible threat to us, we have to make it up and give it powers that don't exist in reality. And even then, most of the time, we still win.

(Perspective of animals.)

"They can kill at a distance. They can control fire. They can camouflage themselves. They can mimic our noises. They can track you, can chase you for days until you drop down dead, can sometimes survive lethal doses of poison to come back again later. They have warped, hyperintelligent, fanatically loyal, physically deformed versions of us as their battle thralls, and often those thralls harbor an intense hatred of their original species. They move around in metal beasts that can crush you without slowing down, and if one of us happens to somehow kill one of them anyway? That's when the rest get real interested."

## [Animal Sacrifices](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/wcds2m/til_the_parthenon_in_athens_was_largely_intact/iiczntr/)

Animal sacrifices were just old school ancient BBQs and an excuse to party.

If you think about the utility of a goat for example, it can pull a small cart, you can load it up with a few small bags or baskets, if it's a female you can get milk, and eventually cheese. Now look at sheep, they can do all that, but they also make some bomb ass clothes if you collect the excess fur they would otherwise scrape off on a gnarled tree stump.

Sacrificing a domesticated animal in those days was like taking your car to the scrap yard. Instead of getting cash out trade in value you could feed your family and village with food from the meat, and sell or use the leather, horns, hooves, whatever, to make various things that are not taste but essential. Killing an animal, even just letting it die of natural causes is messy. If you wouldn't take your car apart on the side of the street, bolt by bolt, then you probably wouldn't slaughter your beast of burden in front of your hut, or even your stable.

Dead animals attract scavengers and predators. They stink and they can cause disease if they aren't taken care of swiftly. The carcasses can also spook the other domesticated animals, causing them to act erratically in ways a simplistic agrarian human might attribute to the superstitious. Clean up sucks too, blood and bile is hard to scrub out of dirt, and even harder to get out of untreated wood, porous stone, and fabric. Pressure washers and detergent weren't a thing two millennia ago. You know what is super easy to clean? Marble. You know what used a lot of marble? Temples.

So you'd take your goat to the temple. She has a broken ankle, a nasty tooth infection no one for a thousand years had any idea how to take care of, and there's also a bit of mange developing despite your best efforts to combat it. You raised this animal since it was a kid. Even among many others you're attached to this animal, but this goat is old as a goat will get and you can see an intense pain in their eyes. You can slaughter it at your hut, and deal with all the everything, or take it to the temple, and have a sort of pre-funeral for your old friend.

You gather your family and friends, Andy head to the temple where you may ask for a ceremony for a few, or maybe you donate and partake in there festivities to come. Sacrificing an animal at the temple allowed them to clean the beast beforehand if possible, drain it and remove any possible rott or diseased parts. They would render any useable materials like horn, leather, tendons, organs, etc, while the meat would probably be split between the donors and the temple or it would be used to feed the priests and clergy, or for alms, whatever.

If you owned a lot of animals it wasn't really a sacrifice, it was just another day. Those people had facilities for that, but for the common person, sacrificing was a big event. If you could timr it right, you could 'please the gods' by sacrificing at the same time others did, maybe to ensure a good harvest. I'm sure mostly it was to get the temple's bullies off your back or maybe some leniency on certain taxes, who knows, I'm just pulling all this out of my ass anyway.

[My point is, that animal sacrifices in the context of ancient history are often represented as a symbolically wasteful ritual that only served a nefarious purpose to enrich the quality of the high priesthood. I'm certain that it got out of hand at many points in time and those are there only accounts that were worth writing about.]

## [Ode to Luton](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/z2ipms/tesco_puts_security_tags_on_milk_after_surge_in/ixhpjsj/)

At least the weather is good in Florida. Luton has a wide array of dystopian weirdness that just baffles the senses.

The town centre is mainly full of chicken shops, even popular fast food options "pizza chicken" and "vegetable house" only sell chicken and not vegetables or pizza.

The knife crime stats dropped when everyone got guns.

Al fresco sex in car parks everywhere, The national trust are at their wits end.

So. Many. Racists. I once saw a modded Vauxhall with a 'Winston Churchill Wrap'. Ironically the most ethnically diverse areas are the safest contrary to some opinions. Bury Park is smashing, but I was knocked off my bike by joyriding racists buzzing pedestrians there.

Bus drivers either refuse to take cash or card. They won't tell you what they are taking that particular week before boarding.

Hitchhikers are 50/50 escaped mental health inmates. The police strongly recommend not picking them up.

Someone replaced the bumpers on my van with older models when I was parked there. Next time they stole my spare wheel.

I saw a car upside down in a tree, and a burning truck.

It is in one of the richest and safest counties in england, but skews the stats so badly you would think you were in a warzone.

Living in a greenhouse seems to be a legitimate housing option.

Many of the flats near the train station are owned by sleazy londoners to prey on young women who are worried about being homeless.

It has an airport. People still avoid it.

I stayed in a pirated Easy Hotel that wasn't part of the 'Easy' chain and listened to someone get murdered overnight. Entire room seemed coated in maple syrup.

The whole town is AirBNBs. They are the best and safest option but I once stayed in one where I had to exorcise someone's computer of 'bad images'. The safest option is the pub over the road from the Police Station in Dunstable for obvious reasons.

I once had a book I was reading handed in behind the bar of a Wetherspoons as a 'Suspicious Object'

I stayed with someone who was so racist she wouldn't turn left out of her house. Her ex-husband whispered to me from a bush, laughed and ran away.

I have a list. A long long list. I lived many lifetimes when I was there for only 3 years.

## [Why don’t sister of battle utilize terminator armour? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1cc5l46/why_dont_sister_of_battle_utilize_terminator_armor/)


The real purpose of terminator armour isn't that it's x% more protective than power armour. The purpose is the following:

1. It is capable of being teleported in.

2. It can carry heavy weapons that would otherwise need to be mounted on at least a light vehicle, and close combat weapons that are so heavy they're basically breaching tools.

The Sisters tactical doctrine doesn't involve teleporting not-really-man-portable weapons squads into close quarters combat in an attempt to kill enemy commanders or vital emplacements right at the start.

They're doing fine with their own model of combat, which is being so berserk on faith and flamer fumes that they can spit on Khorne from where they're standing.

## [The significance of the Gul rank](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/dtyjoq/the_significance_of_the_gul_rank/)

> It seems that the Gul rank among Cardassians is really ill defined. According to Memory Alpha, it's equivalent of "Captain", but it's also applied to such wildly different levels of responsibility and authority as governors of entire planets, heads of an entire Order (which in Cardassian terms seem to be equivalent to an entire military or intelligence agency) or lowly captain of a freighter. All are called Gul, with no qualifiers whatsoever.
>
> It would seem that Cardassians don't distinguish between rank and role as real life military organizations do (you can be the captain of a ship, your role, while having a different rank from captain, for example), making it really hard to pinpoint the exact relevance of such a rank as Gul.
> 
>So my question is twofold: what is the benefit of having such an ill-defined militarily rank, especially for a highly ordered society such as the Cardassians, and how do you suppose the chain of command manages to work in spite of this?



This is one of those things that probably started as an inconsistency in writing, but actually ends up making Cardassian culture a lot more alien and interesting.

There's at least a couple of explanations that are perfectly workable for this, and would likely work fine in real life as well.

The first is simply that "Gul" doesn't actually refer to one rank, but actually to a whole bunch of different ranks that make up a chunk of the Cardassian rank structure. If we take a look at the real world, there are parallels. Whether someone is a one-star Brigadier General in charge of maybe a few thousand men, or a four-star full General, it's common to refer to them simply as "General Smith" rather than "Brigadier General Smith", simply because there's no need to be more precise in an informal context. That could cover someone commanding anything to a few thousand men to millions. The person you're speaking to knows who you mean. One might imagine that the Cardassian military has something similar, with, say Gul 1st class to Gul 6th class filling in the ranks equivalent from Lt. General to Major but everyone just referring to them as "Gul" most of the time. The same would apply to various Sergeant ranks, to Admiral ranks, and to Roman Centurion ranks, where you'd just call someone "Admiral Smith", "Sergeant Smith", or "Centurion Smithus" rather than regurgitating their entire title.

An alternative is that Gul is only a single rank, but that the Cardassians make a great use of positional authority. It might be that the commander of a whole Order or planetary occupation does indeed have exactly the same rank as the commander of a mining freighter, but that their position is far more junior within that rank. This is also not uncommon in the real world. IIRC in the USA, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs outranks the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who outranks the Chief of Staff of the US Army, who outranks the Vice Chief of Staff of the US Army, who outranks the commander of United States Army Forces Command. There is a very clear order of hierarchy and seniority, and yet all of them are invariably four-star generals. Other examples would be an officer in charge of a unit such as a platoon holding the rank of Captain reporting to a company commander who was also a Captain, or aboard a US Navy supercarrier, where the captain, the executive officer, the commander of the air group, and the deputy commander of the air group all hold the substantive rank of Captain. In the Cardassian fleet, every ship may be commanded by a Gul who reports to a Squadron Commander who is a Gul, who reports to a Wing Commander who is a Gul who reports to an Order Commander who is a Gul or Legate.

We know that the Cardassian Central Command is extremely politicized, to the point where it seems to actually run the government. It may be that the rank structure is an extension of this politicization, and that even if there is theoretically a parity between two Guls, everyone knows who is more powerful and more senior.

>It could also be a reaction to the politicization. Fewer ranks means they don't have political arguments about promotion lists which would be redundant to arguments about assignments and billets. I would guess that this is better for competent but politically disadvantaged officers who would otherwise need to get separate approvals, probably years apart. 

 I very much like this explanation. Having the entire upper-middle echelon of your military command being one rank means the top tier (Legates/Central Command) can pick and choose who gets important or favourable assignments based on loyalty etc rather than being forced to give out appropriate missions based on rank or deal with all the red tape to formally bust an enemy down a rank / promote a sycophant. 

> Another possibility I don’t see mentioned here, but perhaps Gul and Legate are more equivalent to Starfleet’s divisions than ranks. That is, Gul is equivalent to the command division. Legate is equivalent to a flag officer division which Starfleet doesn’t have, but would be analogous to the office of the Admiralty that seems to exist in the Orville.
>
> Legate probably comes with a lot of pomp and circumstance - say protocol has Legate officers being announced at formal events whereas Guls are not. There may also be more paperwork and more expectation of attendance at said formal events. Cardassian society may expect that a Legate Officer is almost 100% networking and big picture management.
>
>Dukat tried that but then quickly finds that he’s at a disadvantage. His egotism turns off people and his subordinates are trying to step up and take over things he likes to have control over. The other Legates have enough influence to snub him, and it looks bad if he’s the only Legate forced to hang out with the Guls. Finally, it’s so ordinary. He’s a self-made man, he doesn’t like looking like just another stuffy Legate who got there through family connections. He needs to be recognized as different.
>
So next chance he gets, he uses his power to throw a wrench into established protocol, which for a Cardassian is an almost orgasmic display of status. He becomes head of Cardassia but remains a Gul. Now nobody knows what that’s supposed to mean and he gets to define it. He gets to pick and choose the control he wants while deferring the obligations. Every time he shows up at an event he gets to watch the master of ceremonies sweat and try to guess what protocol he wants, the anonymity of a Gul or the pomp and circumstance afforded a Legate.
>
>He’s swarmed by the other Guls looking for favours, and the Legates are forced to come to him and “stoop” to talking with the Guls, a fact which the other Guls also take sadistic pleasure in after being regularly snubbed themselves. This further inflates Dukat’s personal popularity with the rank and file military, while infuriating the military leadership that he felt had always been unfairly prejudiced against him.
>
>And of course, there’s less paperwork as a Gul.


## [Fantasy Timekeeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/c1g5z6/comment/erds3oz/)


I ran a game where the different races' quirks were built around how they kept time.

Dwarves - baseline seasonal time, recognizable calendar. Divided into three ages related to the status of the world's "Totally Not Moria" dwarven delving. As the economic powerhouse, this is the calendar of trade and collaboration.

The Primitive Age, BD (Before Delving, used like BCE)

The First Age, MH (years of the Mountain Hold)

The Second Age, LD (Long Dark)

Elves - weird magic time.

“We’re currently in the first turn, sixth repetition, twelfth cycle, seventh preparation, and eleventh passing.” This has been the case for six dwarf years now.

Elves always inherently know the date but can't tell you when it will change. When it does change, every elf in the world knows that it did. Sometimes it's a significant event changes the date. Sometimes it just changes without explanation.

Humans - Adaptable and a story hook

Happy to use whatever time the surrounding culture uses, so long as it isn't gnomish.

There's a shattered continent that uses it's own human time system. Two ages: a First Age from the shattering of the continent in the years prior to dwarven civilization, and a second age centered around the crowing of a mysterious cult figure called the Lunar King.

Hobbits - Calendar? What's that?

They have names for overly-specific points in time during the day, but no calendar. They use local calendars if necessary, but it can require real arm twisting to force a hobbit to make plans more than 1 day in advance.

What about agriculture and other calendar uses? "I wake up each day and I think, 'Well now Mister Bilbol, what needs a'doing today?' and then I do that. You know when it's time to plant. You know when the sky looks threatening. Just take it one day at a time, it's all any of us can do!"

Different communities have different "dialects" of times, too. It is utterly bewildering to outsiders who haven't spent enough time with the locals and functions as a shibboleth in some ways.

They have a reputation for being both spontaneous and totally unreliable.

Gnomes - Damn it please no not again.

Gnomes figure the first day of the first year to be that of the oldest written record they have been able to find and place chronologically. There's a council that sometimes updates this. All gnomes abide by this system religiously.

Sometimes there are redactions.

Yes, the gnomes make a point to go through their entire written body of knowledge and meticulously update the dates to maintain the standard. There's a whole profession built around fixing outdated texts.

Gnome timekeepers suffer the most murders and suicides, statistically, of any other demographic.

The last cleric I played: "Mighty Gorum, who art in eternal battle, hallowed be thy name. I beseech thy bloody counsel in a matter of morals-"

Gorum: (butts in) "Cut his fucking head off!"

The walls of your tavern will be stained by sprays of your blood from my sword. Your entrails will spell avarice across the ground so that all who dare enter this desecrated establishment will know your sin. Our Lord in Iron has spoken!"

There's a few things to keep in mind about Ustalav.

1. Everyone you meet is probably dominated by a vampire and cannot be trusted. This includes friendly innkeepers, unfriendly sheriffs, other vampires, your party members and you.

2. If you think, "It'll be fine, I just have to hold out til morning", you're gonna have a bad time. Due to cloud cover and fog, conveniently placed mountain ranges, and evil magic, it's never morning in Ustalav.

3. Ustalav runs off of horror movie tropes. If you're a lady, project an aura of quiet strength and make sure you're able to adapt to any situation. If you're a male, chances are you're dead already, but try to attach yourself to the obvious heroine and hope you make it out alive. For either gender, whatever you do, DON'T SLEEP WITH ANYONE. You sound like you might be plucky comic relief, which is good because those characters live longer so there's a stark contrast from all the terror.

4. If a party member suggests splitting up, don't listen to them. They've been dominated by a vampire and can no longer be trusted.

5. Remember that a wooden stake to the heart kills most things, not just vampires, so it's a useful tool.

6. Don't look into mirrors, that's a vampire's favourite time to be behind people.

7. If someone can conclusively prove they aren't a vampire, they're a werewolf and can no longer be trusted.

8. Like stakes to the heart, fire will kill most things. There is no such thing as too much fire. Can't make an omelet without putting a few vampire-infested villages to the torch. If anyone objects to burning down an entire village to kill one suspected vampire, they've been dominated and can no longer be trusted.

EDIT: Well this got bigger than I expected. I'm glad so many people have enjoyed this. Join me next time for "Varisia: Gypsys have most definitely stolen your children" and "Numeria: What you don't know can and certainly will hurt you"

## [Doctor Who RPG Premise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/77eb61/comment/dolpp69/)

Here, I found it. Sorry about the formatting. It's not meant to be a complete setting, more a shareable premise to use with existing Doctor Who stuff.

### A STITCH in Time
(Special Tactics & Intelligence - Tardis Command Hub)

### Introduction

_There it is. Sitting darkened in the center of a mass of cables and makeshift computer terminals, the legend come to life. A blue box, unusual only in the amount of material pouring out of her cracked-open door. You know the stories, but seeing it in person is so different. It’s quiet, dark, and surprisingly foreboding. Through the cracked door, you see a blackness bigger than you imagined. You feel something odd as you look: a sensation like a mighty animal has been woken from a hibernation sleep, and is not entirely happy about it._

The Doctor is gone. Dead, we think. We weren’t certain until we found the Tardis: when we found it, deep underground, it was shut down. We feared it was destroyed, our scientists couldn’t breach it for years. Everything changed when the daleks came. The invasion has nearly devastated us, but brought a strange gift that we think will lead to their downfall: we have reverse engineered enough of their technology to finally breach the gates of the Tardis herself, and restart her power core.

You’ve been selected, not because you are the best for this job, but because there are so few of us left. That, and because - this is going to sound strange - but because it will only let a few people interact with it. Most of us can get inside but… well, you’d best see for yourselves. We selected people with think the Tardis will, erm… like.

Stop looking so confused. We don’t have time for this. Really, we don’t. The daleks learned the location of this facility, which is why we’ve cut your training short. You are literally our last, and only hope. Get in the alien time machine, and see if you can turn it on. Find out what happened to the Doctor. If you can, find a way to stop all this from happening.

Get in! Now! They’re at the gates!

_The room shakes as the outer blast doors evaporate. You hear the metallic chorus you’ve come to associate with death and terror. Grabbing your gear bag, you hustle towards the blue box as the inner doors explode open. Your commander and two of your teammates evaporate in blasts of green light as you scramble towards the door. Four more are left outside as the door, suddenly and without warning, slams shut, cutting the power cables in the process._

_You are in darkness. From outside the doors of the alien ship, you can hear the daleks and their blasters, the screams of the remainder of UNIT and Torchwood making their last stand. In the relative quiet inside, you can hear the breathing of your teammates, and someone lets out a quiet sob._

_Then there’s a strange, grating pulse that ebbs and flows in your very bones._

### Premise

This is Doctor Who, without the doctor.

You are a group of people from the near future of Earth, after a dalek invasion that was not stopped by the Doctor. UNIT and Torchwood put up a valiant resistance, but were barely able to slow down the monstrosities. You, along with a handful of other Resistance members, were recruited for a special initiative. Nobody quite knew what it was about, although there’d been rumours that no one really believed.

You are not military. Some of you may have backgrounds in Torchwood and UNIT, but most of the seasoned veterans died in the early invasion. You are not warriors. Fighting Daleks gets you killed. What you are is skilled and resourceful: those are the people that the Resistance selected for this job. People who might have been companions, had the Doctor been around to meet them.

Now you’re on the Tardis. It was asleep, possibly in its death throes, when human and dalek technology forcibly awoke it. It’s damaged and irritable. It seems to have a mind of its own, and none of you know how to steer it. You’re going to have to see if you can fix it up, and if you can’t figure out how to control it yourself, maybe it can be reasoned with. Until then, it’s taking you where it wants to go and you’re just going to have to deal with that.

### Character concepts

Players should choose characters that they can imagine being the Doctor’s companions. Most player characters should be humans, but the setting should allow aliens and time-travelers as well. The Tardis may well lead the party to pick up someone from another timeline it knows will be helpful going forward. Beyond that, the creation of the party is freeform: Perhaps the players want a more paramilitary group. Perhaps they want a ragtag band of misfits. Perhaps they are a collection of the Doctor’s actual previous companions (some of whom may be quite unhappy to see the Tardis abused so). Anything could work, and will create a very different game. Generally, Time Lords should be avoided. The whole point of this game is to create a more classic equal-footing RPG party in Doctor Who. Having one character play the Corsair would ruin that.

### The Tardis

The Tardis is, in a sense, the Game Master in this setting, and will be intolerant of people it sees as villains in the story. It leads the players to places they’re needed, like it’s always done with the Doctor. It has some goals of its own: it wants to be fixed, for one thing, and it will lead the players to things that can help fix it up. Does it want to find the Doctor? Maybe, but maybe that would create a paradox. That’s up to you. Maybe it has some other goals related to what caused the Doctor’s disappearance. The players’ interactions and relationship to the Tardis should be a central part of the game as their characters learn that the Tardis is sentient and has a will of its own.

## [Timmy and the Perpetual Motion Machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7x2sbj/comment/du5k0nf/)

When Little Timmy stopped to say,
'For heaven's sake, of course!
I've only gone and found a way,
Without external force!'

He clapped his hands with growing glee,
And grinned and jumped for joy -
'Oh sharp and smartly artful me,
I'm such a crafty boy!'

He spied it spin and swing and swoop -
He watched it turn with pride.
But Timmy caused a feedback loop.

And Timmy fucking died.

## [Bathroom Social Norms](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5pnwni/comment/dcsjrqx/)

This is one for people using public toilets or restrooms, but who aren't using a cubicle, or come out of the cubicle and find themselves in a situation where they are alone in the restroom foyer (where the sinks are). You need a minimum of one person in the cubicles but the maximum amount is infinite.

Have a quick listen to see if anyone is approaching to come in, or there is any rustling etc to suggest that the occupant/s are about to exit their stall. Silence? Great, the anony-stage is set for you to make someone's day.

You now have free reign to create whatever scenario you want. You're completely anonymous. Fill this space with whatever would make you laugh if you were sat silently laying one out.

Wanna exit a cubicle, whistling, then abruptly stop, make stifled grunts and say "oh gees, I wasn't done......hgghhh.......nowIam ......Oh well, I guess I'm hot dogging this one all the way to walmart for some fresh whites". - do it.

Wanna stick a piece of toilet paper to your shoe, stamp your foot down near the view point of the engaged cubicle, say "not this time poop paper, you're staying here", before acting out a voiceless struggle, crashing into cubicles etc. - Go for it.

Wanna do two sides of a conversation?

"Hey Harry."

"Hey Hugh!"

"What happened to your shoes, Harry?"

"The force of my shit blew them off, Hugh. Don't ask how, but I think one of them is in the U-bend of the stall a few doors over. The other one came out here and I've only found the laces." - Dooo ittttt.

Think about it. You have the chance to comically enter into someone's life. Put a smile on their face and give them something to tell their SO about when they get home. or even, dare I say it, give some terribly shy person a conversation starter for when they get back to the office. Remain anonymous and it's the perfect crime, has no repercussions on your reputation (so long as you don't do it in your work bathroom) and can make someone's day. Try it, but get ready to run. And bear in mind, the floor can be slippy.
