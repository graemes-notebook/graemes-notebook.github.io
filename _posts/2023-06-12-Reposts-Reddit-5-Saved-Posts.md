Ok, so I'm not entirely sure how this stacks up with terms of service and whatnot, but honestly at this point I'm just trying to avert digital entropy. Still, if you're the author of one of these posts, and want me to take down one of these posts, message me and I will.

That said, here's a selection of my saved posts that I think are too good to lose to a random subreddit purge.

## [Why would a goblin join an adventuring group?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/4ozf5i/why_would_a_goblin_join_an_adventuring_group/)

> "Grish-Gnash don't understand... adventurers is like paradise for goblins! Sure sure, longshanks are weird, but listen... listen!

> Longshanks just SHARE FOOD. Someone finds it and offers to everyone. Some cook big feasts! Some make magic boom feasts that fill up stomach for HOURS. HOURS!! No getting hungry minutes later.

> Whole thing elaborate scam, has to be. Adventurers pull fur over other longshanks eyes and Binky get to ride along and enjoy all the prizes that go with, only for fighting in return!"

Why would a goblin join an adventuring group? Why WOULDN'T they? Goblin tribes suck for the individual. A party allows for a goblin to do everything they would've wanted to do, only with more freedom and more reward for it!

How do you get the group to accept you though? Become the adorable mascot or the sad puppy dog.

> "Sometimes longshanks worry hallway trapped or door have spikes, or that something poisoned. So Binky do what Binky do best, and run in yelling at traps and scaring spikes! Sometimes Binky get hit by things and it hurts Binky, but the, HERE'S THE CRAZY CRAZY PART, Party heals Binky up and THANKS BINKY FOR DISARMING TRAPS!"

If your goblin is truly gobliny and foolhardy, reckless, and desperate enough... and you focus that energy all into endeavors that minimize damage for your other members, they'll love you for it.

> "Squishy squishy mage was worrying that big scary scary was gonna charge him and stabby stab before he could make magic boom booms. So Binky says, Binky says 'OY YOU [Goblin words, Goblin Words]!" and runs straight at him, jumps on him, wrings his neck, and lights him on fire! Now big scary scary focusing only on Binky and mage make boom booms go BOOM!"

Totally in character for goblins to draw ALL of the attention to themselves, to make themselves the most despicable target, to make anyone want to kill them simply for existing. Combined with reckless endangerment and you just absorb LOTS of damage that would've gone to squishier targets. If you take the Roll With It feat and pump your Acrobatics score really high, you're looking at essentially having DR equal to your Acro-minus-five + d20 once per round when you're hit with melee.

## [Obnoxious cursed items](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/4q4cz1/obnoxious_cursed_items/)

**Hammer +3, Dwarf Thrower**

When wielded by anyone but a dwarf, this acts as a normal war hammer. Whenever a dwarf tries to wield this hammer in combat, however, it picks him up and hurls him bodily at his opponent, at +3 to hit and for ld12 +3 hp damage (to the dwarf--the opponent takes only 1-4 hp damage); the range is 60'. If the dwarf misses his opponent, he (again the dwarf) takes double the above damage; if his opponent has time to "set" or "ground" a weapon such as a spear or military fork-well, it's not a pretty picture. Incidentally, this hammer is an unusually handsome weapon, featuring the finest work of the elvish master smiths.

**Robe of Blending (Waring 3-speed)**

To all appearances, this is a perfectly ordinary robe. If the clasp is examined closely, however, it will be revealed to be a sliding switch with four setting (including "off"). "Chop" does 2-20 hp damage to the wearer, "mix" does 4-48, and "liquefy" makes me sick just thinking about it.

**Robe of Useless Items**

This robe appears to be a garment of no great value--appearances can deceive, but not in this case. The wearer will notice several odd-shaped patches on the garment, primarily because they chafe in uncomfortable places. Detaching one of these patches causes it to actually become one of the following items:

* A bag containing 1,000 lead pieces;

* A one-inch length of rope;

* One pair of high, hard boots, halfling size;

* A wooden ladder, 25' long, with three rungs;

* Half a pair of safety scissors;

* A string of electrical Christmas tree lights;

* A rubber dagger and a glass shield (matched set);

* A book of exalted deeds, written entirely in Thieves' Cant;

* A pint of sovereign glue (undiluted with oil of slipperiness) in a tightly stoppered unbreakable bottle;

* A treasure map pinpointing the exact location of an immense hoard, relative to "the old oak tree:' "the big rock:' "the woodcutter's shack:' and "the bend in the river" (extraneous details such as the name of the kingdom or the continent are omitted);

* A 25th-century death-ray gun, l00% accurate within 300', that kills anything it hits (batteries not included);

* A letter from Ed McMahon, telling the PCs they may already have won $20 million19

Once removed, a patch can never be replaced on the robe. When enough patches have been removed, the robe becomes very drafty, so it is wise to reserve the patches for emergencies.

## [The (real life) sandbox tree seems like it would be a great idea for an RPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/aqn4of/the_real_life_sandbox_tree_seems_like_it_would_be/)

I’m imagining it in DnD, where it is a strange tree that detonates if a medium or larger creature gets within 10 feet. Adventurers often approach them due to the weapons and armor that can often be found near its trunk. All creatures within 30 feet of a Blast Tree when it expels its seeds must make a DC 10 (or whatever) Dex save or take 1 point of piercing damage as a barb impacts you. Failing a subsequent DC 15 (or whatever) Con save means that the barb burrows into you, and cannot be removed by non-magical means. Constructs automatically succeed this saving throw.

Every time you complete a long rest, make a DC 15 Con save, and tally the results in a similar fashion to death saving throws. For every failure, your AC while not wearing armor increases by 1, and your walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. Those around you may notice that your skin is becoming rougher and more bark-like, and your hair appears more mossy. Every success returns your skin and hair to a more natural tone, and increases your speed by 10 feet, provided that your speed is being reduced by a failure. Accruing three successes before three failures ends the effect and restores your walking speed, although your skin and hair retain their plant-like appearance.

Upon accruing three failures, you complete your transformation into a Blast Tree. Roots grow from your limbs and a trunk will begin to sprout from your abdomen. Your worn and carried equipment is pushed off of you as your trunk grows. You lose the ability to speak, use language, or move. You are also blinded and deafened, but gain Blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. Casting Greater Restoration on the afflicted target removes all effects and returns the target to its original form at all stages of infection.

After one year, your new body matures and sprouts small barbed seeds. You have no mouth and you must scream.

## [How Shit Happens](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bywk9m/a_friendship_tree_emmanuel_macron_gave_to_trump/eqnr8fs/)

In the Beginning, there was The Plan; but The Plan was without form; and man created The Procedure.

Darkness was upon the face of the employees; and they were sore afraid; and they looked upon their supervisors and cried: “It is a crock of dung and stinks to High Heaven!”

And the supervisors spake unto the project supervisors, saying: “It is a bucket of manure and intolerably malodorous.”

And the project administrators spake unto the section managers, saying: “It is a vessel of fertilizer and exceedingly strong.”

And the section managers spake unto the department directors, saying: “It promoteth growth and is very powerful.”

And the department directors spake unto the company president, saying: “It augmenteth development and productivity.”

And the company president looked down on The Procedure and declared: “AND IT WAS GOOD!” And so the Plan became Policy. This is how Shit Happens.

## [Ruins and the emotions they evoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/uekjql/ruins_and_the_emotions_they_evoke/)

...one of my favorite ruins-related discussions is in the talmud (the jewish oral torah - and writings/sayings/commentary collected over the first 500 years CE). 

The talmud is written in a conversational format, often in the context of a debate, and sometimes references itself \[the book\]. ) it can be dense and confusing, and also it goes on very long tangents. it's much less poetic, but deeply human and funny:

The ruins comes up as a *side tangent* on a very long discussion about "from what time do we recite the shema?" which asks things like "what's the difference between nighttime and dusk? when does the day start, or end? how do we know the answer?" and so on. 

so during this conversation we're told a story about a Rabbi who ran into the prophet elijah (who sometimes just...shows up to things, as you do):

>Rabbi Yosei said: I was once walking along the road when I entered the ruins of an old, abandoned building among the ruins of Jerusalem in order to pray. I noticed that Elijah, of blessed memory, came and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance until I finished my prayer.   
>  
>When I finished praying and exited the ruin, Elijah said to me: Greetings to you, my Rabbi.  
>  
> I answered him: Greetings to you, my Rabbi, my teacher.   
>  
>And Elijah said to me: My son, why did you enter this ruin? 

and Yosei says he wanted to avoid being distracted by passerby while praying, to which Elijah says he should've said the shortened version of the prayer that exists for that purpose. And then Yosei explains the things he learned on that day from Elijah, one of them being "one may not enter a ruin."

 Then the talmud explains some more:

>The Sages taught, **for three reasons one may not enter a ruin:**  
>  
>**\[1\] Because of suspicion of licentiousness** \[prostitution, adultery\],   
>  
>**\[2\] because the ruin is liable to collapse,**   
>  
>**\[3\] and because of demons.**   
>  
>Three separate reasons \[for the prohibition on entering ruins\] seem extraneous, so the Gemara \[part of the Talmud\] asks: Why was the reason because of suspicion necessary? Let this law be derived because of \[concerns of\] collapse.  
>  
>The Gemara answers: **This law applies even in the case of a new, sturdy ruin, where there is no danger of collapse.** Therefore, the reason because of suspicion is cited **in order to warn one not to enter a new ruin as well.**

...which, "new, sturdy ruin" makes me laugh every time. but it goes on like this, methodically asking why you need three different reasons to not go wandering around in ruins. why isn't *one good reason* enough?

and to summarize:

* demons are usually only a threat to individuals, not people in pairs or groups, so it wouldn't apply if more than one person went into the ruin
* however -- pairs or groups could be getting up to some funny business, unless they have upstanding reputations, so it really depends on the people in question 
* so why not just say the only concern is suspicion *and* demons?
* well, because two upstanding people entering a ruin aren't suspicious AND they aren't at risk of dealing with demons because there's two of them. obviously!

Then it says this:

>The Gemara considers the third reason, the prohibition against entering ruins is because of demons. Why is it necessary to include: Because of demons? Let the prohibition be derived from suspicion and collapse.   
>  
>The Gemara responds: There are cases where demons are the only concern, for example where it is a new ruin into which two upstanding individuals enter, so there is neither concern lest it collapse nor of suspicion.   
>  
>The Gemara points out, however, that if there are two people, there is also no concern of demons. **As such, the question remains: In what case can demons be the sole cause not to enter a ruin?**
>  
>The Gemara responds: **Generally speaking, two individuals need not be concerned about demons; but, if they are in a place known to be haunted by demons (see Isaiah 13:21), we are concerned about demons even with two people.**

**which is my favorite, because this is a guide to being horror genre savvy.**

**don't go into the ruins because:**

1. people think you're up to no good in there
2. ruins are definitionally structurally unsound and therefore a collapse-risk
3. if those other reasons don't sound convincing, have you considered: that shit's haunted and full of demons?

## [What are some facts about humans that make us sound bad ass?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9dihxq/what_are_some_facts_about_humans_that_make_us/)

We are the only superpredator known to exist. Our best friends are apex predators we allow to live in our homes and treat like children, and we are sufficiently skilled at predation that we have allowed them to give up hunting for survival.

We accidentally killed enough of the biomass on the planet that we are now in the Anthropocene era, an era of earths history that marks post-humanity in geological terms. We are an extinction event significant enough that we will be measurable in millions of years even if we all died tomorrow.

We are the only creature known that engages in group play fighting. Other animals play fight, but not in teams. This allowed us to develop tactics, strategy, and so on, and was instrumental in hunting and eventually war.

We are sufficiently deadly that in order for something to pose a credible threat to us, we have to make it up and give it powers that don't exist in reality. And even then, most of the time, we still win.

(Perspective of animals.)

"They can kill at a distance. They can control fire. They can camouflage themselves. They can mimic our noises. They can track you, can chase you for days until you drop down dead, can sometimes survive lethal doses of poison to come back again later. They have warped, hyperintelligent, fanatically loyal, physically deformed versions of us as their battle thralls, and often those thralls harbor an intense hatred of their original species. They move around in metal beasts that can crush you without slowing down, and if one of us happens to somehow kill one of them anyway? That's when the rest get real interested."

## [Animal Sacrifices](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/wcds2m/til_the_parthenon_in_athens_was_largely_intact/iiczntr/)

Animal sacrifices were just old school ancient BBQs and an excuse to party.

If you think about the utility of a goat for example, it can pull a small cart, you can load it up with a few small bags or baskets, if it's a female you can get milk, and eventually cheese. Now look at sheep, they can do all that, but they also make some bomb ass clothes if you collect the excess fur they would otherwise scrape off on a gnarled tree stump.

Sacrificing a domesticated animal in those days was like taking your car to the scrap yard. Instead of getting cash out trade in value you could feed your family and village with food from the meat, and sell or use the leather, horns, hooves, whatever, to make various things that are not taste but essential. Killing an animal, even just letting it die of natural causes is messy. If you wouldn't take your car apart on the side of the street, bolt by bolt, then you probably wouldn't slaughter your beast of burden in front of your hut, or even your stable.

Dead animals attract scavengers and predators. They stink and they can cause disease if they aren't taken care of swiftly. The carcasses can also spook the other domesticated animals, causing them to act erratically in ways a simplistic agrarian human might attribute to the superstitious. Clean up sucks too, blood and bile is hard to scrub out of dirt, and even harder to get out of untreated wood, porous stone, and fabric. Pressure washers and detergent weren't a thing two millennia ago. You know what is super easy to clean? Marble. You know what used a lot of marble? Temples.

So you'd take your goat to the temple. She has a broken ankle, a nasty tooth infection no one for a thousand years had any idea how to take care of, and there's also a bit of mange developing despite your best efforts to combat it. You raised this animal since it was a kid. Even among many others you're attached to this animal, but this goat is old as a goat will get and you can see an intense pain in their eyes. You can slaughter it at your hut, and deal with all the everything, or take it to the temple, and have a sort of pre-funeral for your old friend.

You gather your family and friends, Andy head to the temple where you may ask for a ceremony for a few, or maybe you donate and partake in there festivities to come. Sacrificing an animal at the temple allowed them to clean the beast beforehand if possible, drain it and remove any possible rott or diseased parts. They would render any useable materials like horn, leather, tendons, organs, etc, while the meat would probably be split between the donors and the temple or it would be used to feed the priests and clergy, or for alms, whatever.

If you owned a lot of animals it wasn't really a sacrifice, it was just another day. Those people had facilities for that, but for the common person, sacrificing was a big event. If you could timr it right, you could 'please the gods' by sacrificing at the same time others did, maybe to ensure a good harvest. I'm sure mostly it was to get the temple's bullies off your back or maybe some leniency on certain taxes, who knows, I'm just pulling all this out of my ass anyway.

[My point is, that animal sacrifices in the context of ancient history are often represented as a symbolically wasteful ritual that only served a nefarious purpose to enrich the quality of the high priesthood. I'm certain that it got out of hand at many points in time and those are there only accounts that were worth writing about.]

## [Ode to Luton](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/z2ipms/tesco_puts_security_tags_on_milk_after_surge_in/ixhpjsj/)

At least the weather is good in Florida. Luton has a wide array of dystopian weirdness that just baffles the senses.

The town centre is mainly full of chicken shops, even popular fast food options "pizza chicken" and "vegetable house" only sell chicken and not vegetables or pizza.

The knife crime stats dropped when everyone got guns.

Al fresco sex in car parks everywhere, The national trust are at their wits end.

So. Many. Racists. I once saw a modded Vauxhall with a 'Winston Churchill Wrap'. Ironically the most ethnically diverse areas are the safest contrary to some opinions. Bury Park is smashing, but I was knocked off my bike by joyriding racists buzzing pedestrians there.

Bus drivers either refuse to take cash or card. They won't tell you what they are taking that particular week before boarding.

Hitchhikers are 50/50 escaped mental health inmates. The police strongly recommend not picking them up.

Someone replaced the bumpers on my van with older models when I was parked there. Next time they stole my spare wheel.

I saw a car upside down in a tree, and a burning truck.

It is in one of the richest and safest counties in england, but skews the stats so badly you would think you were in a warzone.

Living in a greenhouse seems to be a legitimate housing option.

Many of the flats near the train station are owned by sleazy londoners to prey on young women who are worried about being homeless.

It has an airport. People still avoid it.

I stayed in a pirated Easy Hotel that wasn't part of the 'Easy' chain and listened to someone get murdered overnight. Entire room seemed coated in maple syrup.

The whole town is AirBNBs. They are the best and safest option but I once stayed in one where I had to exorcise someones computer of 'bad images'. The safest option is the pub over the road from the Police Station in Dunstable for obvious reasons.

I once had a book I was reading handed in behind the bar of a Wetherspoons as a 'Suspicious Object'

I stayed with someone who was so racist she wouldn't turn left out of her house. Her ex-husband whispered to me from a bush, laughed and ran away.

I have a list. A long long list. I lived many lifetimes when I was there for only 3 years.
