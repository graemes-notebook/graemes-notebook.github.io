User Hostile Design

The shape of the thing is misery

The price is the death of joy

We take card payments too

But only via the App

![A melodramatic stylised image of a barbed wire security wall](/assets/barbed-wire-midjourney5-2.jpg)

The picture is a bit melodramatic, but going into cities nowadays stresses me out. There's loads of barbed wire everywhere, security fences all over the place, and the only time you'll find parking is somewhere you have to pay for via an app, that requires you to sign up for an account, verify an email address, and agree to a ream of terms and conditions. I never thought I'd find myself missing pay-and-display machines, but here we are.
