* 3x180g bars of Bournville chocolate
* 75g Morrisons Plant butter
* 140g Morrisons Rice Crispy Cereal
* ~80ml Morrisons Golden Syrup

# Implements


* Baking tray/tin (the one I have is about A4-sized, and about a centimetre deep)
* Baking/greaseproof paper
* A mixing implement (a wooden spoon))
* A saucepan
* A sharp knife
* A set of scales

# Instructions

* Break or chop the chocolate into small chunks.

* Melt 150g of chocolate in a non-stick saucepan on a low heat - the lower the better. It's very easy to end up burning the chocolate, which tastes unpleasant.

* Add 50g of butter and the golden syrup, and allow the butter to melt.

* Quickly mix the pan until it has an even consistency. 

* Add the rice crispies and mix until the cereal has been fully covered in the chocolate syrup. Try to avoid crushing the rice crispies while doing this.

* Spread the crispies into the baking tray. Use the back of a knife or similar flat edge to ensure a reasonably flat top surface.

* Melt the remaining 360g of chocolate in the saucepan (ideally having scraped out all the rice crispies from the previous stage, to ensure an aesthetically pleasing result)

* Add 25g of butter and mix until even.

* Quickly pour the melted chocolate over the rice crispies, and spread with a knife or flat edge to ensure an even top surface.

* Place in the fridge to cool.

* Once cooled, cut into squares and serve.

# Notes

This is basically a recreation of an old family favourite converted to vegan ingredients. If that's not a priority, there's no reason why this recipe couldn't be made with milk or even white chocolate, for a sweeter final result. The top layer can also be omitted for a simpler "topless" alternative, as it can become arduous when making larger trays.

As always, be careful to avoid burning the mixture - adding the butter and syrup is the worst stage where this can go wrong, as the mixture is both burnable on higher heats and quick to set on lower ones. Allow the butter to fully melt before mixing to ensure the mixture stays warm enough.

Also note the current inexactitude of the amount of syrup added - the original recipe specified 1/4 of a cup of undefined size, 80ml is a estimation of the volume that has produced good results in previous attempts.
