# The Spidertroth

The deep places of the world contain an uncountable number of ancient horrors seldom seen on the surface of the world since the first dawn. The vast, vast majority of these entities are of natures wholly incompatible with those that dwell in sunlight, but there are some scant few with whom accords may be reached and bargains struck. One such accord that has managed to endure is the spidertroth - the still-honoured peace accords between the surface peoples and the Great-Attercoppe-Who-Dwell-Below. The surface kingdoms that fought the war proceeding the accords have long since crumbled to dust, but the Attercoppe Beneath have long memories, and the stipulations upon the surface folk have long since become part of cultural tradition even in those places that do not remember the Spidertroth itself.

## The Law of Unworked Stone and Untamed Soil

A fundamental underpinning of the spidertroth is the recognition that the untamed soils - that is to say, farmable topsoil environment - is the domain primarily of the surface dwellers, while unworked stone - the natural byways beneath the earth, is the domain of the attercoppe. The troth recognises that there are potentially settlements of one in the domain of the other, but asserts that these are to be considered outposts, not territories.

This is understandably a point of contention between dwarven holds and the attercoppe where their spheres of influence overlap, as dwarven holds often encompass significant subterranean territories. The prevalent style of angular, ostentatiously decorated stonework near-ubiquitous in dwarven holds likely grows out of an attempt to invoke the 'worked stone' provisions in the law, in addition to the deliberately smoothed and polished walls and ceilings preventing wall- and ceiling-climbers from travelling unobserved within the hold.

## The Law of Dwellings Above and Beneath

Another important component of the spidertroth is the recognition that inhabited dwellings, wherever they're located, should not be trespassed in. This is a significant stipulation because unlike many of the supernatural horrors of the surface world, the Greater Attercoppe experience no inherent difficulty crossing a threshold, which is otherwise one of the strongest passive defences available to panhumanity.

The law of dwellings is completely bidirectional, and applies independent of species - an occupied attercoppe web on the surface has the same right to remain undisturbed as an occupied dwarven barrack below the ground. An unoccupied dwelling in any case may be traversed but should not be damaged in the process. The law has limited provisions regarding property and chattel in cases where the rule is breached - by way of example, miners stumbling into an attercoppe nest would expect to be allowed to leave, rather than being slaughtered, and any incapacitated members carried out, but pack animals and equipment might be forfeit at the whims of the nest. Equally an attercoppe that builds a web in a human home would expect to be allowed to leave uninjured once the situation becomes apparent, but would have no right to insist on taking with them any trapped prey.

The latter example is especially important in that the stipulations are understood to apply to the lesser attercoppe as well - folk memory may be fuzzy on the details of why, but it is near universally considered terribly bad luck to kill spiders, even if you destroy their webs, and you should always remove them from your house rather than killing them.

## The Law of Unseen Passage

The law of unseen passage is similarly bidirectional, and simply states that both sides have a reasonable expectation to pass each other by in peace, and that neither side should attempt to set traps or lures intended for the other. It requires that such passage as covered by the law should be out of sight and as quiet as possible, and that travellers exercising the protection it offers should stay well clear of one another.

# Why?

So basically, in the real world, I quite like spiders, at least in the abstract. Most of the things they eat are things I don't like, and their preferred spaces are mostly the kinds of corners I couldn't use even if I wanted to. For as long as I can remember I've had a unilateral truce with spiders, which I tend to mentally think of as the spiderpact, or spidertroth. Basically, the terms are that, as long as they stay away from my food, bed and desk, and don't crawl on me, I'm mostly happy to let them be about their business in peace. If they build webs somewhere that's obnoxious, I get rid of them, but I make sure not to hurt the spiders.

The punishment for spiders that break the terms of this alliance is that they get thrown out the window. Which, I should add, doesn't hurt them. The terminal velocity of a spider in atmosphere is well below the the speed at which they'd be harmed - they're too light. Although it's obviously still not ideal for them, as outside they're likely to be eaten. I haven't had to carry out spider defenestration very often in my current flat, but the previous place I lived had terrible trouble with giant house spiders who seemed incapable of of staying out of the way.

As to why this became an RPG idea, I read [Incunabuli's post about cobhounds](https://www.incunabuli.com/2019/07/cobhound.html) ages ago, and ever since I've had the idea that that intelligent giant spiders are woefully underused in modern rpgs. The cobhounds are probably lesser attercoppe, according the treaty, possibly living weapons from the ancient wars abandoned when their masters retreated from the surface.
