Depending on how you have come across this blog, it may or may not come as a shock to you that I'm a long-time user of Reddit. Depending on your own internet habits, you may or may not be aware that Reddit currently undergoing what is best thought of as a moderator strike, the initial flashpoint being new API fees causing the shutdown of many third-party tools, but the larger being context being the various user-hostile decisions that Reddit has taken over the last few years. The details aren't really important here, just that I've been increasingly unconvinced that I'm going to keep using Reddit indefinitely. And to that end, I thought I'd repost those of my comments that might stand as mildly interesting in their own right here. I'll do a few posts, breaking out the larger subreddits on their own.

I have considered the risk of doxxing myself by linking this blog and my Reddit account, but honestly, if you've read other posts on this blog, you know more about me than you will from reading my reddit comments, and the entire goal of the rehosting here is to ensure that anything even slightly worth reading brought coming across, so there's not really much point.

The process is somewhat complicated by the fact that some of my better standalone posts have been in /r/askScienceFiction, or other subreddits that have locked down as part of the strike, so this series will have to shift and change a bit. In general I'm more of a lurker than a poster, and my comments have tended to be posted in a very specific set of circumstances:

* I got to the post early enough to read all the comments,

* The comments present at the time can't have answered the question posed in the post,

* I either know the answer, or at least I have a good answer that seems reasonable,

* By the time I've assembled my thoughts into a post, I'm still interested enough to bother posting.

I've only had one comment deleted by a moderator, from /r/OutOfTheLoop, because it didn't start with Answer:, and by the time I realised, somebody else had made the same point, so I didn't bother to do anything to fix it. That post is below.

As a note on formatting, the headers are generally the post text, with the comment immediately below being the post being the post body, included if that was relevant to the answer I wrote. In general, italics are comments from me now, editing the post, to contextualise and include a reply somebody else made that continued the conversation, or because having reread the original I find I have more to write. Title questions, post bodies, etc have all been tweaked for readability, spelling and grammar, and are not necessarily verbatim (although they usually are)

## What is up with President Trump leaving the WHO? What exactly do we get out of being a part of or in the WHO?
> When we pay into these huge groups, what exactly do we get out of it? Iâ€™ve seen numbers from we spend anywhere to 100 to 400 million dollars a year for it. Do we really get 400 million dollars worth of something back out of it? Or is it just a big political scam on the world?

I'm assuming you're an American, so I'll answer from that perspective. As a note, the US contribution to the WHO budget this year is about 115 million USD, (the most recent assessment I can find is here: https://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/revised-2019-invoice/en/#U) I'm not sure where that 400 million USD figure combined is coming from -- at a guess, that's probably the combination of the various UN specialist agencies.

What the US gains generally by funding international organizations such as these is enormous amounts of soft power, remarkably cheaply. To put it into perspective, a single F-35B has a unit cost of about 115 million USD, and the WHO does far more good for American interests than buying one more fighter jet.

The specific focus of the WHO is on international public health, working to track an eliminate health problems affecting huge numbers of people -- they played a key role in coordinating the elimination of smallpox, and near eradication of polio, and they're working on HIV/AIDS, ebola, TB and malaria. Even if you didn't feel the obvious humanitarian value of eradicating these diseases justified it's budget contribution, the strategic importance of this work to the US should be obvious given the current pandemic -- the world is far too connected to safely ignore disease outbreaks in other countries.

_In general, this is something I feel fairly strongly about, so I'm going to continue the rant below:_

While nobody is suggesting Donald Trump was in any capacity a good leader, even far better ones seem to undervalue the strategic value of participating in bodies like the World Health Organisation. Global standards bodies in general play a massive role in defining the shape of the world economy, in the aggregate if not individually, and that goes doubly for something like the WHO, which is tied into pandemic response and health outcomes as well. Having representatives in the room when they make decisions is the difference between your country being fully accomodated into whatever they're responsible for, or being an afterthought, and fine, that may not be anywhere near as exciting as a fighter jet, but long term, they'll do far more to advance your countries's situation.

And by the standards of government spending, membership and funding these organisations is tiny. This is a tangent, but it's one of those things that's annoyed me about Brexit so much in the UK. Even ignoring the history and context of it all* it's just such a strategically bad decision not to participate in things setting international standards. But this is a tangent that I can go on a massive rant about, and it's not the point, so I'll leave it alone for now. One day I might write a proper Brexit post, but I suspect I'd get too annoyed trying to write it.

*The history and context of it all, being that, for the last millenia, the only time a major alliance between France and Germany (or its predecessor states) has worked out in our favour has been when we're also part of it, and when we're not, it usually goes badly for us.
