[Throne of Salt](https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/) is one of my favourite blogs for assorted RPG ideas. They do these posts periodically that they call slushpiles, full of cool ideas that aren't fully developed, but could probably be used something. This inspired me to write up a couple of ideas I've had floating around that I'll probably use next time I need something for a scifi game.

One of my personal favourite rules for designing aliens is to straight up steal from nature. Firstly, because evolution creates things far weirder and more interesting than anything I can come up with on my own, and secondly because players will have an easier time visualising them. In a novel it's all well and good if people only vaguely have a sense of how a species looks as long as the characters are clear cut, but RPGs need all the players on roughly the same page for the game to go well, which means that easily visualised aliens are the way to go. Unlike TV however, alien designs aren't constrained by human actors or CGI budgets, so rubber-forehead aliens need not rule the roost.

The [Ort Skadak]({% post_url 2022-08-09-Ort-Skadak %}) are pretty much an example of this -- giant flying ants, with the eusocial habits that entails, except with inspiration from Star Wars Genosians, because that's what they were using the stat block for in the original [Star Wars 5e system](https://www.sw5e.com/) we started playing using.
