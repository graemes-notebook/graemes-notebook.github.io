There are few RPG subreddits I subscribe to, but I post infrequently on them, so I've consolidated them in to one post.

## In Call of Cthulhu, What Are Some Ideas for an Agency that Upgrades Over Time

Assuming that the campaign starts with the agency starts as a shoestring operation running out of somebody's living room, there's a lot of scope for non-combat upgrades:

Better premises -- Initially just to a real office, initially just the smokey back room of a local business, maybe a laundry or a newsagent, but later on to somewhere more upmarket, maybe their own building.

Support staff -- It's pretty easy to come up with the staff you'd need to fill out the agency as it develops, based off what a real business like this would need. If your players start with just them, an early 'upgrade' might be a company secretary who can answer the telephone and take messages (aka plot hooks) while your characters are out saving the world, while some ideas that immediately spring to mind as later additions are a researcher (depending on the kind of jobs they take, this might be a specialist in some obscure field, but maybe more usefully perhaps somebody who assembles press clippings for whatever topics your characters need to monitor, and indexes their files (No small undertaking for an archive of press clippings and case files)) personal assistants/secretaries/typists (Typing is a specialist skill at this point, and a well written letter on company letterhead paper will get your investigators past any number of bureaucratic hurdles) and a lawyer (who can bail the cast out when their latest job goes horribly wrong).

Specialist contacts -- A reputable business is unlikely to have a forger on staff, but knowing one might come in handy. Contacts in the criminal world, law enforcement and journalism are all likely to be useful in a call of cthulhu campaign, but other professions are useful as well -- local sellers of specialist goods (books, antiques, etc) are a staple, but even the local newsagents might be the source of interesting clues. Translators are another useful contact that would need to be cultivated

Contacts and premises are also a good way to tie your evolving agency to the consequences of their cases: that plucky reporter the players saved from the brain slugs when your agency was running out of the laundrette might get in touch with the players again at a later date to give them a lead after their editor made them kill a story about this creepy law firm. The fact that when it turns out that the law firm are actually cultists carrying out ritual sacrifices in their offices, they're arrested and now there's a nice office going cheap because of all the bloodstains... well, that's just the world of business.

Vehicles -- for a business just starting out buses and the occasional taxis are probably what your investigators will be using. Once the business expands a company car makes sense, and from there several cars. An armoured cabin is possible, but unlikely to be a feature of their day to day car -- armour is heavy, and the cars of the day were already weighty. Late 1930s is post-prohibition, but I recommend reading up on the Prohibition-era Moonshine Runners for examples of the kind of upgrades that might have be practical.

As I've alluded to earlier in the post, all of these 'upgrades' can be rewards for a case successfully completed, and the source of future cases -- staff might be recruited from the victims of the last case if they can't go back to the way things were, and can get caught by the consequences of the current one when they open the booby-trapped mail sent by the cultists to your offices.

## What breed of horse is a destrier?

It's a type, rather than a specific breed, they're the biggest and strongest type of warhorse. You also have coursers, which are lighter and faster warhorses and rounceys, which are much more common, and used by poorer knights, or the retinue of wealthy ones. The three are collectively called chargers, because they're expected to sustain a charge against infantry (most non-warhorses won't charge people reliably, even cart and draught horses, which are much larger than them)

You might also see a type of horse called a palfrey which was a comparably expensive type of horse to a destrier, but bred for long distance ambling.

There are other smaller types like hobby horses and cobs and so on, which were occasionally trained for war, but not for the classical armoured cavalry that we think of as knights.

## RPG campaign or scenario ideas you've always wanted to play or run.

Sharpe's Tentacles -- During the height of the Napoleonic Wars, Major Sharpe and the Chosen Men discover something unearthly in the foothills of Spain. (The Sharpe universe has heroic riflemen and infantry skirmishes, with plot armour in full effect. Lovecraftian horror is bleak, nihilist, and everybody can and eventually will die)

## How can I make my fungus-based orcs born from the rotting remains of a dead elder god weirder?

Are they individually sentient? Do they act like a hive mind, the more there are, the smarter they get? Or do the 'individual' orcs we see regard themselves as an individual -- perhaps they see themselves as a colony that acts in concert?

How do they grow to larger forms? Does each orc age? Do they merge? Why are there less of the larger forms? Is it just that they usually get killed before it happens? Do they reproduce by fission? Or budding?

Are they tool-using? Presumably if they're fungus colonies, they're not going to be developing metallurgy, so what do they use to fight? Wooden weapons? Do they grow claws/talons from their own biomass?

## In Golarion (the official setting for the Pathfinder RPG) does common knowledge include Earthfall? How much world history is recorded?

It seems likely to me that most people have at least some idea about Earthfall, if only on the level of "Rock falls out of the sky, flattens ancient human empire". In scholarly circles, the basics are probably fairly well understood. To help put this in perspective, Earthfall happened about ten thousand years before the present day.

On Earth, ten thousand years ago is the early neolithic period. We have ruins and artifacts from this period, and we can deduce a fair amount about the climatic conditions around the world. An asteroid impact that massively altered the shape of a continent would be something we'd expect to know about, even if it didn't shatter an empire and create something as obviously an impact crater as the inner sea.

In addition, history on Golarion seems to be much better preserved than it is on Earth, for a number of reasons. There are people alive in the present day who are hundreds of years old, and that's before you get into the various creatures like dragons, undead and outsiders that live essentially forever and could potentially be convinced to share their knowledge. The lifespans of societies seem far longer as well -- the entire dwarvish culture in the present day is connected to the Quest For Sky, which was a direct consequence of Earthfall, and the current situation the elves are in is largely due to their Earthfall evacuation.

I expect it depends on where your campaign is set in Golarion as well. My campaign is set in Osirion, which has an abundance of magically preserved tombs buried in the desert sand. We recently played through one of the old pre-Pathfinder modules, which has an npc who is still fairly sane and chatty despite having been alive during the reign of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension, some six thousand years before the present day. I imagine a party in somewhere like Galt, where multiple empires have risen and fallen and everybody seems to be rebelling all the time, would have a much harder time investigating the area's ancient history.

## How can I show depict how non-American cultures have adapted as part of a post-Earth-shattering diaspora

Firstly, architecture. Obviously the technology level of the setting affects the degree to which cultural preferences can be accommodated -- if your humans don't have any kind of artificial gravity, the need to work around that will overtake everything else -- but so long as you have centrifugal gravity or better, you can show things that the current culture has inherited from pre-diaspora designs.

For an example of what I mean, think about housing. Some cultures tend to favour smaller cohabiting groups than others. In Britain, for example, we spend huge sums of money on buying or renting tiny new-build box homes rather in preference to living with our parents or with housemates. The same trend would probably continue on space stations: lots of very small, self-catering cabins, with only one or two occupants. Other cultures favour multigeneration cohabiting groups, with parents, grandparents and children all living in the same home. This would probably carry over to space with larger communal areas shared between a few cabins, probably with shared dining facilities.

A second question is how Earth-centric cultures and religions have adapted to space. Assuming Islam is still practised in your setting, for example, how have they adapted the Qibla (the praying facing Mecca*) tradition? Do they pray facing in the direction of Earth? If so, how? On a ship or station with centrifugal gravity, the direction of Earth isn't going to be constant, it's going to move quite rapidly relative to somebody standing in the spin section. This would be solvable by putting the mosque on the central axis of the ship, so that the prayer room is in zero gravity, and worshippers can pray facing Earth. Of course, this raises the question of of how they manage to perform Salah without gravity... Regardless, this would give you some very distinctive buildings that give the ship a less conventionally american character.

I suppose my advice basically boils down this: Work out what cultures survived whatever event lead to the diaspora, and work out how they have to adapt to the practicalities of living in space. A lot of the "big" stuff like food is going to be strongly tied to the technology and resources your people have, rather than their culture, but the more personal things like religion and family will make a big difference to the character of each location

*Actually they face the Kaaba, which is a big cube-thing in Mecca. Given that Earth is off-limits, that would raise the question of whether Muslims are still obligated to perform the Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca). It's quite possible that the diaspora version of Islam doesn't require it, on the grounds that it's not possible, but it's also possible that they've somehow agreed on a "new Mecca". Either by agreement, or by physically putting the city of Mecca in a big spaceship and taking it off-planet. Either way, that could be a character motivation, and I'm sure you could hang a few interesting plots off it.

## What would happen if a PC played 52 card pickup with a DECK OF MANY THINGS? At the very least, that's the most sure-fire way to end the campaign.

I disagree. Admittedly, I'm only familiar with the Pathfinder version of the Deck of Many Things, but assuming the group wanted to continue the campaign, it's mostly just bad for the person who drew the cards, and even then they could probably survive if they were clever.

The Deck of Many Things reputation for breaking campaigns comes from the party using it to try and get out of a situation, only to make it worse in unpredictable ways. In a controlled situation, it's nowhere near as bad.

The way my group handles magic items, you probably couldn't play 52 card pickup with a deck of many things anyway. Powerful magical items are at least vaguely sentient, even if they're not specifically intelligent, and don't appreciate being messed around with. If you tried, the cards would either all land in a neat pile, or it would be treated as an attempt to draw 52 cards, and the effects would resolve sequentially.

## I want to run a custom game set in the Stargate universe. Which system to use?

I ran a Stargate game about a year ago using Savage Worlds that worked out quite nicely. The the pulpy feel of the system and Stargate is a natural fit, and I have particular praise for the way savage worlds handles wildcards (PCs, major NPC antagonists, etc) and extras (redshirt airmen, nameless jaffa, etc) which makes it easy to GM Stargate-style gun battles.

## Food and Water and Zombies

Do you need the zombies to survive without food or water long term? If your zombies are of the "alive but feral, without higher reasoning" variety, you could have them retain the instinct to drink water -- if your zombie plague is waterborne, that might be a deliberate infection vector. It also means your zombies will roam near freshwater sources, further making life harder for your survivors (and better boil that water before you drink it...)

If I were running a zombies game, I probably wouldn't have zombies cultivate food -- agriculture is pretty involved, and needs more active reasoning than I associate with zombies. Humans can live up to three weeks without food as long as they have water, it'd make sense for the zombies to be able to do the same.

That would give your game two distinct phases -- the outbreak, where the population of zombies explodes from patient zero, and the game is a matter of simply surviving the overwhelmingly massive hordes. The second phase would be once the zombie population drops off rapidly, as the majority succumb to starvation, infection, predation, etc. It would then be mostly safe for the survivors to come out of whatever bunkers they've been holed up in to face the problems of a fallen civilisation, hindered by their fellow humans and the occasional small group of zombies that has managed to hunt food successfully (either because they're slightly less mindless than their peers, or just lucky)

## Setting details for a Mars-based game about aliens doing sinister things to human colonies

Mars' gravity is about a third of Earth's -- people can jump higher, and take longer to land. Things fall more slowly.

Unless Mars in your story has been extensively terraformed, people are going to be living in sealed domes or underground tunnels. You can't go outside without a spacesuit, because if you do you die. Humans living on Mars are more likely to be agoraphobic than claustrophobic.

In general, a lot depends on the details of your setting. If the aliens are from Mars, presumably there's a reason nobody has noticed them before now? If the humans are Mars-born-and-raised, what's their relationship with Earth like? Are they going to assume the alien activities are some kind of Earther conspiracy at first?
