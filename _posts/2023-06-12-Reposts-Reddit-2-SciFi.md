As one of the larger non-currently locked-down subreddits that I've contributed to over the years, I thought I'd start with /r/40klore, but I'm intending to be a placeholder for some of the other science fiction franchises as they become public again.

# Warhammer 40,000

## Why does the Adeptus Mechanicus use stubbers on so much of their equipment?

Heavy stubbers have an unfair reputation for being poor quality in general because of the stub weapons used by other factions -- the guard don't use stubbers much because las weapons have a much lower logistics burden, and any army the size of the guard lives and dies by logistics. Every crate of bullets you have to ship to the front lines is competing with every other item of material that needs to make it through the munitorum's stretched supply lines, and needs to be matched by the supplies to keep barrels unfouled, and machinery cleaned. Lasgun magazines can be recharged in situ with a suitable power source, don't generate much fouling as they don't need to burn powder, and seem to have few or no moving parts. And that's before wading into the different chemical propellants that exist, and that need to be matched with barrel metallurgy and atmosphere in theatre, as well as the shelf lives of whatever you end up using.

Local PDF forces do use stubbers, because most of the considerations that apply to the guard aren't an issue if your supplies are made and used locally. And while local PDFs tend to be comparatively ineffective, that has more to do with whether they're well enough trained to actually hit anything than what happens when they do. And a stubber produced on random agri-world #3999 has about as much in common with the stubbers made in the finest manufactoriums of a Mechanicus forge world as a Kyber Pass special does with the contents of HK's Grey Room.

For the Mechanicus, the main downsides of stubbers are non-issues -- they have full control over their own supply chain, and are only deployed where they have good logistics support (fine, they might end up fighting on an airless tomb world, but if they do, they can make sure they have ammunition that contains its own oxidiser and doesn't need air to work), routine maintenence is their bread and butter, and Skitarii are a cut above random PDF troopers.

For the Mechanicus, and as secondary vehicle armaments particularly, heavy stubbers bring them a number of advantages over fancier options. For one thing, they're easy to install -- mounting a secondary plasma weapon or las weapon on your irreplacable archeotech vehicle with a finickety machine spirit and systems your most knowledgable magos can only speculate about means installing power connections, monitoring systems, insulating things against stray emf, etc. By contrast, attaching a heavy stubber (or to be fair, a bolter) involves a rivet gun, some hopefully-inert hull plating, and can be done by a bored engiseer in an afternoon (which is not to say that it should be...).

I'd also argue a heavy stubber being potentially less damaging than a plasma/phosphor/bolt weapon of the same size is a feature, rather than a bug as a secondary tank weapon. By their very nature, Admech tend to be fighting either in defence of one of their own facilities, or to get their mechadendrites on something they see as rightfully theirs. If the main gun of your vehicle channels the unabated fury of the Omnissiah, that's great, but you may well find yourself needing something you can fire at those heretical tech thieves standing close to the promethium tank. The Imperium tends to reinforce structures quite heavily, and a stubber can mince infantry well enough while being unlikely to do serious damage to valuable infrastructure. Heavy Stubbers are preferable to bolters in this context for the same reason, bolt rounds tend to leave bigger craters, and once you've won, you don't want to add "unexploded ordnance" to the list of things your servitors have to deal with when they're hosing the remains of the enemy out of the place.

_There was one comment, pointing out that guns would actually work in a vacumn, because they normally have oxidiser in the powder anyway. Which, yes, that's what I said, but what I replied was actually:_

You're right -- I'd misunderstood the problems with firearms in a vacumn. The actual issues would be things like stopping whatever lubricants it uses from boiling away, and providing cooling in the absence of airflow. I think my point that the Mechanicus are more able to address the challenges posed by the environment than most other users of stubbers is unaffected though.

# Star Wars

## There are several cultures that have a taboo on showing your face; how far does this extend to any naked skin?

>Like, how do Mandalorians and Tusken take care of... business when they're not exclusively with their closest relatives? What with stormtroopers in the field? Do these taboos just not extend to their lower regions or is diaper technology just so developed they don't need to think about these issues?
>
>And what if you lose parts of your clothing in combat or in an accident? Will they shun you because your arms or chest or legs are exposed?
>
>Could it even be very specifically a taboo only on showing your face to deliberately make the problem of sanitation without adequate cover easier on whoever needs to do the deed because you can just drop your pants in front of your kin but don't have to look them in the eyes?


I don't think we've had a canon answer to any of these questions, so inevitably this is complete speculation, so bear that in mind.

Minor Mandalorian Spoilers Below.

That said, stormtroopers we have a fairly good answer for -- their uniform code is strict, but not accompanied any other taboos, so they're permitted to remove it when it's necessary to do so. The institutional tradition of stormtroopers always wearing their helmets on duty seems to be a direct continuation of the clonetrooper one, and probably became stronger once the clones were replaced by recruits to maintain the image of faceless implacablity. For the clonetroopers there's little value in showing their faces for identification, and they seem to have adopted quite a few mandalorian military traditions (see below) as a result of Jango Fett's involvement in creating their original training regime.

The uniform wouldn't be as hard to open take care of the necessities as it looks at first glance -- the torso armour has separate upper and lower front and back pieces, and the undersuits worn by the real life 501st have two-way zips, so there's no reason to think the ones worn by their fictional counterparts would be worse. I wouldn't be surprised if the TIE fighter pilot uniforms have some kind of diaper/catheter solution, but given that imperial fighter doctrine doesn't seem to expect multi-hour missions, it's probably rudimentary (given that we see X-Wings being used on long range patrols in the Mandalorian, I suspect the Rebellion/New Republic probably had to put quite a bit of thought into a solution, however).

The Mandalorian armour is similar, but most of the designs we see are made of smaller plates, and the codpiece is entirely separate from the torso armour, which would make it a lot easier to move out the way. Jango and Boba Fett both wear their armour over what look like work overalls, but Din Djarin and the Tribe seem to be wearing trousers that are separate garments to their upper armour, so their's no reason to assume they have any unusual arrangements.

The Tribe's (and the Death Watch from which they descend) prohibition on removing their helmet seems to be an extreme outgrowth of the mandalorian tradition of wearing armour at all times (in the Clone Wars, even the peaceful mandalorian faction seems to wear armour frequently, and their civilian fashions tend to resemble it), rather than specifically about covering their face. The Death Watch are all about being the purest of pure traditionalists, and wearing a helmet even when it's inconvenient is essentially a demonstrative act of faith.

The mandalorian wearing of armour seems to be part of a philosophy of always being ready to face attack (hence all the concealed backup weapons) and not showing vulnerability rather than about modesty or shamefulness. As such, I doubt deliberately choosing to not cover particular body parts is particularly contentious for Mandalorians so long as it comes across as a show of strength rather than weakness. Losing clothing as a result of combat or accident probably is embarassing for them, but mostly not more so than normal -- the main exception that springs to mind is probably having their helmet be removed after being defeated by an enemy -- it seems like it would be seen as particularly humiliating, and seems in line with how Din Djarin reacted in the Mandalorian season 1 finale (despite IG-88's loyalties at the time, Din definitely had a hard time not seeing it as an enemy).

Tusken tribes are the group of the three with the strongest obvious taboos around removing their clothing. From a practical perspective, they all have skirted robes, not trousers or bodysuits, and while they don't have many permanent facilities, there's always a rock or sand dune they can go behind. The clear distinction between male and female clothing suggests they have more taboos around what should or should not be on show, and I'd be astonished if there isn't a religious reason behind the fact the female tusken robe has a mask and shroud when the male one has horns and can turn their head. The underlying practical reason for their all-encompassing clothing is the need to protect themselves from Tatooine's desert environment -- humans in the same conditions seem to adopt clothing made from similar materials and with hoods, both in the real world and in-universe. The Tusken species' presence on Tatooine predates its current desert climate, so their physiology is probably less well suited to deserts than that of humans, hence the unusually high level of coverage. The cultural taboos likely developed from there.

In conclusion: I don't think any of the three groups described has their face-covering traditions as a result of sanitiation issues -- in all cases I think there are more likely reasons for it to come about.
