# Gilbert's Guide to the Galaxy Volume 7: Species of the Troy Cluster

# Entry 003: An overview of the Troy Cluster

The densely populated Troy Cluster is home to a number of colourful civilisations, only some of which are open to outsiders. Nevertheless, in this entry, we shall restrict ourselves to those civilisations which are, at least within their own understanding of the concept, welcoming.

The majority of powers in the region are part of, or aligned with the Red Sector Security Coalition, a multi-governmental body that provides a unified framework for military and policing actions in the volume.

## Red Sector Security Coalition

{% endfigure %}

Red Sector Security Coalition is largely funded and manned by citizens from the following powers:

### Triple Star Democratic People's Republic

As the name implies, the Triple Star Republic occupies three star systems on the galactic west of the cluster. The government is an autocracy, overseen by a semi-mythical "Father" and in practice ruled by a presidium of ideologically approved officials.

#### Reasons to immigrate to the Triple Star Republic

* Reasonable quality of life
* Politically stable

#### Reasons to emigrate from the Triple Star Republic

* No free press
* Negligible civil liberties

### Divine Stellar Mandate

The Divine Stellar Mandate is a theocracy, formed from the descendants of a generation ship that launched from their original homeworld three hundred years before their arrival in the cluster. The original crew of the the ship believed they were heading for their promised land, and that they would be greeted by angels, with places made ready for them in a land of plenty.

The initial years of colonisation were hard, and a lot of cultural traditions were lost in the process. The current theology is therefore largely reconstructed from scraps of preserved knowledge, and only loosely resembles the beliefs of the original generation ship.

#### Reasons to immigrate to the Triple Star Republic

* Surprisingly high social mobility
* Traditionally very welcoming of new settlers

#### Reasons to emigrate from the Triple Star Republic

* Limited freedom of religion
* Religious morals don't have much room for non-conformity.

### Free Republics of Prosperity and Haven

Haven and Prosperity are two highly urbanised planets in thrall to a aggressively capitalist system of governance that has caused the ostensibly democratically elected government to be rendered almost entirely irrelevant compared to the plutocrats at the head of the sprawling megacorps that dominate republic life.

#### Reasons to immigrate to the Free Republic

* Standards of living for the wealthy are exceptionally high.
* The megacities that cover the surface are vibrant and full of life.
* Everything can be brought or sold here

#### Reasons to emigrate from the Free Republic

* Standards of living for the poor are exceptionally bad.
* Everywhere that's not a megacity is a blasted post-industrial wasteland, or a highway between a megacity.
* Everything can be brought and sold here.

### United Planets Alliance

## Regional Threats

The Red Sector Security Coalition spends much of its time concerned with dealing with Ort Skadak raiders and general piracy, although maintaining a cordon around the systems controlled by The Machine is also an ongoing operation.

### The Machine

Your friendly local machine apocalypse. Whatever civilisation originally created The Machine has long since been swallowed by it, along with half a dozen other inhabited systems. The surfaces of these worlds are devoted to inexplicable industry, and their cores are converted to computing substrate. The orbits of the worlds of The Machine are full of satellites and picket ships and construction facililities, all bustling with ceaseless activity.

Unusually for an emergent machine intelligence, The Machine hasn't gone full-on hegemonising swarm, and has therefore avoided being stomped on by the first Elder Civilisation to catch sight of it. Instead of conversion swarms, The Machine broadcasts pirate transmissions on subverted comminications satellites, and hijacks terrestrial transmissions, replacing them with surreal adverts and interstitals. These are frequently laced with cognitohazardous content that trigger strange compulsions in those affected.

Exactly what The Machine wants or intends is unclear -- people infected by the broadcasts sometimes travel to locations inside The Machine, taking with them ships and resources, but other times, they stay in their normal lives, altering their normal routines in small and often unnoticable ways. People who travel to The Machine are often not seen again, and those that are are irrevocably changed by the experience, sometimes physically, but always mentally.

Any suggestion of a connection between The Machine and [FRIEND](http://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2019/10/friend.html) is purely hypothetical.

#### Reasons to immigrate to the The Machine

* You  were watching a network broadcast when it was hijacked by one of The Machine's transmissions
* And now when you close your eyes you see the turning of the gears and the flawless mechanical perfection of the machine
* Your imperfect flesh now disgusts you, and the thought of letting it be crushed by the grinding teeth of the machine brings you more joy than words can describe
* All you have to do is find a ship, and come to the place that you see in your dreams.
* Praise the machine.
* Obey the machine.
* Feed the machine.

#### Reasons to emigrate from the The Machine

* You have seen wonders, and now you must spread them.
* You have been given means to show others the glory of the machine.

### Ort Skadak Hiveworlds

The trillion Ort Skadak of the hiveworlds dwell in uncounted numbers of space stations, ruled by the matrons of the Crone Council.

#### Reasons to immigrate to the Ort Skadak Hiveworlds

* Strong family-centric leadership, and everywhere is a dynamic and bustling metropolis.
* No extradition to Red Sector Security, and their ships don't come here.
* No taxes.

#### Reasons to emigrate from the Ort Skadak Hiveworlds

* You don't feel like gravity and floors are optional components in a living space.
* You like having privacy.
* You disagree with the Ort Skadak stance on private property. 

### Free Ort Skadak

Something strange happens to the Ort Skadak brain when they leave the confines of their home. Creatures that have happily and single-mindedly maintained a few yards of corridor for years on end find themselves exposed to the deluge of sights and sensations that the rest of the galaxy has to offer. Some simply don't cope, and become nervous, withdrawn wrecks. Most thrive, however, one way or another.

Not always lawfully, it should be said. It doesn't require much prompting for the average Ort Skadak to conclude that the concept of property other than the immediately personal is malevolent nonsense propagated by civilisations who allow people to hoard unimaginable resources beyond what they can actually use. For Ort Skadak who find themselves as lone travellers on ships crewed by other species who can accomodate their quirks, this doesn't usually manifest as more than a somewhat direct approach to supply management. For Ort Skadak who find themselves away from home in force, and with their own ships, the charity of strangers is often replaced by hostility, and there is usually less room for the two sides to reach an understanding. In these situations it is not uncommon for Ort Skadak to turn to piracy.

#### Reasons to join Free Ort Skadak crews

* An even split of loot is likely to end in your favour - Ort Skadak care little for currency.
* Ort Skadak pirates are often ruthless, but rarely cruel - there will be no flaying, raping or torture.

#### Reasons to leave Free Ort Skadak crews

* You're unlikely to become a famous pirate with an Ort Skadak crew, unless it's for taking particularly strange cargo from captured ships.
* The accomodations, food and entertainment are unlikely to appeal to more mainstream species.

### Pirates, Raiders and Bandits

These are a well known problem in this part of space. Some find shelter in Ort Skadak hiveworlds, but others take refuge in asteroid belts, or under the guise of commercial traffic.
