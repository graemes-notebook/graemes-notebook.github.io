# The Creation of Tak

_In the beginning there was Tak, who wrote the world into being on raw firmament. And for uncounted infinities, the world simply existed, timeless and unchanging._

_Tak was pleased with his creation, but saw that it could be more than it was, and more than he could imagine it to be, and so into the world he wrote the words "All Things Change"._

_And then Tak left, driven by the unceasing urge to create new worlds, in new places_

The 'Creation of Tak' is an ancient creation myth, the oldest known to exist, with both physical copies and oral retellings found in cultures as far flung as the Green Sea, and as isdiosyncratic as the Deep Gnomes of The Black Sky.

What follows after the opening segment varies; usually the gods arise, squabble, create their chosen peoples, curse others, and recede into the depth of the weave. The extent to which these extended mythologies are true and compatible is highly variable. Certainly many gods exist, and esteem one people or another more highly than the others, and in some cases it is possible to construct coherent narratives from the different cultural histories.

Probably the most widely recognised of these is the Elven-Dwarven-Goblinoid cycle, which describes the fall of the Iron Houses of Mandos, and the exile of the elves, their arrival and conflict with the dwarven sky towers, the cataclysmic second creation and the goblin war with heaven. Each of these cultural frameworlds casts the events in very different lights, but feature many of the same figures, made heroic or villainous according to the traditions of the teller. Most significantly, the component mythologies of the cycle align with the geological and archeological findings of the last century, which lends them an unexpected air of verisimilitude.

# The Iron Houses of Mandos

The study of the war between the fallen Iron Houses of Mandos and the Dwarven Sky Citadels is one of the more frustrating aspects of modern. The fact of the war is substantially undisputed, being attested to by both dwarven and goblin writings, as well as many elven sagas.

Unfortunately, because the war occured prior to the cataclysmic events of the Second Creation, no direct physical evidence of either kind of structure has been discovered. This claim can be made with confidence despite the many ancient ruins that have been subject to only cursory study thanks to a dwarven triptych that forms part of the altar of the forefarthers in the hold of Fenhammer. The three panels of the triptych describe, in meticulous detail, the physical appearance of one of the Iron Houses of Mandos, a dwarven sky citadel that allegedly guarded "the throat of the world", and the location where the two supposedly collided.

Inconveniently for archeologists, the location it describes can be unambiguously pinpointed by astronomical measurements, which place it roughly at the centre of the Circle Sea, and substantially above sea level, on a mountain that clearly no longer exists.
