_Time stands still._

From these palatial rooms overlooking the Piazza of the Martyred Lady, you can see the pyre, and the priests.

A witch is to be burned, and you could very easily stop it.

The double rank square of guards stand in formation around the dias, holding back the crowd. Their halberds and shrouded rifles, and polished halfplate mark them out as formidable veterans of the Faith's wars. They pose you no threat. No weapon produced on this primitive dirtball can harm your liquid metal bodies, and no armour this world has can withstand your inbuilt weaponry.

But slaughtering your way through the assembled masses would not be subtle. Would not be elegant.

The Minds disapprove of inelegance. And their projections put the price of unsubtle intervention at ten million lives. You will have to come up with a new plan...

## Premise

A few months ago, I started rereading Iain M. Banks "Culture" series, and I was struck how easy Contact/Special Circumstances would be to adapt to a tabletop RPG. The basic form of the Special Circumstances intervention in the series is a human (in the setting, 'human' means an organic person from one of the many vaguely humanoid species with roughly similar bodyplans, rather than an actual earthling) and a Drone (the first book came out in 1987, drones weren't a thing in real life then, but the bodyplan is similar, just instead of being electric motor driven, they use antigravity and 'fields' and are host to a fully independent, human-comparable intelligence) being dropped into a situation by a Mind (strongly-superintelligent AI) who gives them a mission objective that may only loosely intersect with what they're actually there to do. That their real purpose is usually some variation of 'cause a useful kind of chaos' is a perfect fit for the typical RPG group.

Unfortunately, my pool of potential players included only one person who has read any of the books, so I had to make some adjustments for easy gameplay. Rather than the Human-drone team, I thought the solution would be to adapt the E-Dust Assassin from one of the books for the players - in the books the dynamic between the human and drone is complicated, and would feel a bit unbalanced. I also had to tone down the abilities a bit - as much as fields and effectors are iconic technology for the series, they also need quite a lot of explanation to make them not feel arbitrary, and for the scenario I had in mind, they wouldn't be particularly useful anyway.

Fortunately, pop-culture has a really good reference for a toned down E-Dust Assassin - The T-1000 from Terminator 2, a liquid metal killing machine who can turn into anybody, turn limbs into blades, etc. Antigravity is easy to explain, especially using the Sardukar from the Dune movies as a reference point, and giving them a CREW seemed like a good compromise for not needing to explain knife missiles - another iconic technology from the books.

The canon-rationalization is that this is Project EPILOGUE, a private project of the ROU Paperclip Auditor, and possibly the GSV Sufficiently Advanced Technology, rather than anything more official. Their deployment is implicitly justified by the briefing, but the explicit justification is that ROUs are either minimally or totally uncrewed, and the mission is a rushed deployment, so these are the best assets available, or at least the best assets the Paperclip Auditor is prepared to drop unsupported into a possible trap.

## Briefing

Once the players have had an initial investigation of the scene, I told them they had a message from the ROU Paperclip Auditor with the mental equivalent of a "READ ME NOW" flashing red attached to it, and then told them that they were here to find and possibly rescue two people, Jubal-Rabaronsa Ortesa Montka Oteo (Ortesa Oteo) and Loash Armascott Wu-Handrahen Xato Estral (Armascott) (Culture names being point of origin information for humans and hardware specs for Drones was touched on). I then read them the following briefing text, with a few breaks for questions:

The briefing is not conveyed as words, but rather a flurry of graphs and logs and itineraries leading to the understanding of events. The deluge makes clear that Otesa Oteo is our man on the inside, one of our people adjusted to look like one of the locals. They were brought here by the GCU Temptation to Interfere about a year ago. They were discreetly accompanied by a the Drone Armascott. Given the local technology level, the threat to either of them was deemed minimal, so a non-sentient module was left in a nearby asteroid belt in case they needed an early extraction. The GCU Temptation to Interfere then continued onto its next Point of Interest, and was therefore out of range (on the order of four weeks travel time) when it received a notification from the module that Armascott had missed its last scheduled check-in. No further communications have been received from either the module or Armascott.

The GCU Temptation to Interfere requested assistance from its home ship, the GSV Sufficiently Advanced Technology, which dispatched the ROU Paperclip Auditor as the ship able to assist the soonest. It's now 3 days later.

_At this point I had to explain the ship classifications: a module is a small craft, basically a luxury version of a star trek shuttlecraft. A GCU (General Contact Unit) is a mid-sized vessel that basically does a higher-tech version of what Starfleet does, look at interesting things, do science, and generally have adventures. A GSV (General Systems Vehicle) is a massive vessel with a huge population, basically the Culture equivalent of the big city, except mobile. An ROU (Rapid Offensive Unit) is a fast warship, although there's a bit of euphemism treadmill around pretending they're disarmed or just fast couriers, or just flat out lying about how well armed they are. As part of the defensive mix of the GSV, the ROU Paperclip Auditor wears its warship status proudly_

The ROU Paperclip Auditor did a hard burn to get here. The module didn't respond to comms, and the asteroid it was supposed to be hiding on shows plasma spatter consistent with weapons fire. There's no response from Armascott or Ortesa Oteo's dermal implant.

Rather than risk engine degradation with a hard burn into what increasingly looked like an ambush, the ROU has deployed you via displacer, and will then brake in a more restrained fashion and be back to take up a proper position shortly [defined by a flurry of graphs and projections that the players should understand as narrative convenience]

The players objectives are as follows: find out what's happened to our people, rescue them if you can, disturb the status quo only in ways that don't disrupt the precarious stability of the society.

The situation on the planet is messy - dozens of kingdoms, associated with one of the two schismed branches of the church. The ideological and theological similarities between the two branches render them all but identical to outsiders, but nevertheless each sides regards themselves as the true faith, and the other as dire heretics.

_We took a moment to clarify that this was a protestant-catholic, sunni-shia kind of deal, and that the place we were in was the equivalent of the Vatican_

A large scale holy war between the two factions has thus far been averted, thanks entirely to our intervention (Ortesa Orto is only the latest in a series of embedded assets) but tensions remain high, and it would take relatively little to spark a conflict that the Minds project will cost ten million lives over the first three months.

## Mechanics

I settled on [https://bladesinthedark.com/](Blades in the Dark) as the system to use for the game - I fancied something fairly straightforward with dice pools, which would cope with the players having access to some very exotic equipment and abilities without needing pages and pages of stats. I also decided early on to steal a couple of concepts from Vampire the Masquerade V5, which also has powerful players who need to keep a low profile most of the time. Firstly, using abilities would always succeed against normal people - if the hypertech robot assassin wants to shoot somebody with a laser, there's no rolling to hit, it just hits. If they want to punch somebody in the chest hard enough their hand comes out the other side, they do, no strength check. Secondly, when they're doing something that I decide does need a roll, failure will almost always be in the form of failing to pass as human. A bystander might have been looking at the wrong moment, or an adopted form may not be quite right, or so on.

## Gamemastery notes

I had a few notes I'd made ahead of time. There would be four scenario clocks with six segments each:

* Return of the Paperclip Auditor

* Panic in the Streets

* Few Men Even Considered The Possibility of Life on Other Planets

* The Bloodsoaked Reformation

The main locations of the adventure would be

* Ortesa Oteo's rooms overlooking the Piazza (the starting point for the scenario)

* The Bastion of St Alecto, a fortified hill near the Cathedral, in the style of Castel Sant'Angelo

* The Chapel of Storms, or the Angel Affronted, the tallest tower of the Bastion of St Alecto, home to a famous ceiling painting in the vein of the Sistine Chapel, a massive lightning conductor protecting the Cathedral from lightning strikes, and a Nariscene Allegiance Colonial Intelligence officer.

The players would eventually make their way to the Chapel of the Angel Affronted, where they would find the Nariscene Colonel, a damaged but still dangerous encounter suit, and the blasted remains of Armascott. The Chapel itself would be internally damaged from their showdown, the drone having lost the encounter, mainly due to the drone's unwillingness to cause large amounts of collateral damage. Armascott did still do serious damage to the Nariscene's encounter suit, halting their plans until it made repairs.

More broadly, the players would discover that the Nariscene has taken the mantle of an angelic visitation, prompting internal conflict among the clergy, with Otesa Oteo being on the losing side. They spoke out against 'the Angel' and the other clergy turned on him. The Angel didn't order Otesa burned, but is entirely happy with the outcome.

The Nariscene Allegiance has claimed this planet for their uplift program, which puts them in conflict with Contact's policies of quiet meddling. They're quite happy to let the planet descend into a massive war, as it will make it easier for them to ensure their preferred factions come out on top. The Culture considers that unacceptable, but if they players are inclined to talk the situation out, the Colonel will listen, and even pass the matter up the to their superiors. They won't agree to formally stop their operation in the meantime, but will point out that pragmatically they're pretty limited in what they can do until their encounter suit is repaired. The Colonel will readily tell the players that they fought and killed Armascott, and that the drone died well.

If it comes to a fight, the encounter suit has massive armoured tentacles for melee, plasma cannons as its primary ranged weapons. If the fight draws out, the Colonel will resort to using effectors as ECM, and eventually use a rack of missiles concealed in the suit's armour belt.

## Actual Play

In the end, the vagaries of planning meant we had two players, which worked out very well. They settled on calling themselves Alpha and Prime, with the gimmick that neither could decide who was older and therefore in charge.

Once I'd given the opening narration and briefing, they had a quick look through Otesa Oteo's apartments, came to the conclusion it had already been thoroughly searched but subsequently tided up, and found Armascotts physically supremely hidden, but electronically obvious surveillance gear, and reviewed enough of the recordings to determine that Otesa had been arrested in the early hours of the morning by a contingent of palace guard. They put together that the witch about to be burned was absolutely Otesa Oteo, minus an arm and an eye (I would have told them if they hadn't jumped to the conclusion themselves). They also concluded that the person Otesa had been in bed with was likely the son or close relative of of the local pseudopope. We established that far more of Armascott's surveillance equipment was set up for birdwatching than seemed entirely reasonable.

Once they headed down to the crowd, they watched a priest in black robes with a purple flowery logo on his robe give a fiery oration against heretics and witches. The other priests on the stage were seated, and mostly very old cardinals, and the pseudopope. The players received a short, open channel broadcast from Otesa, using hidden radio, hoping that the displacer flash they'd seen in their rooms had been Armascott returning to rescue them. They referred to the priest as 'that Weasel' and the name stuck.

One of them made their way to the front of the crowd, near where the guards were, while the other went to where the richer section of the crowd was. Both started trying to rile up the crowd, the one near the front priming them to rush the stage and deal with the witch themselves, while the one at the back provoked a local bravo into a fight. The guards noticed, and dispatched a couple of men to break it up, opening a gap for the mob at the front to break onto the stage.

Under the press of the crowd, the player on the stage decapitated Otesa Oteo, taking the head and fleeing. The guards weren't able to stop them and they were too busy with the crowd having invaded the stage. The player at the back of the crowd waited till the attention of the others was elsewhere, let the bravo stab them, and drew the sword into their body, grinning menacingly. The bravo fled.

As the players regrouped, they heard the sound of gunfire and screams from the crowd. It became clear that they had sparked a riot.

_A note on decapitation: it occurred in a fairly early Culture novel that a character was decapitated and subsequently rescued, and their body eventually regrown. Otesa had been established early on to be sporting quite a lot of technological augmentation, and the players made a convincing enough case that they could keep the head reasonably preserved inside their body. Under the circumstances, it was a justifiable belief that it would work, not just random._

After that, they took on the forms of a portly cardinal and a decorated soldier, and made their way to the Bastion of St Alecto, having concluded that few of the Cardinals would be going home today with rioters in the streets. They encountered no serious opposition, but did have to force their way past a crowd to get into the bastion. Inside, they changed their forms, with the Cardinal becoming the Psuedopope's son. At this point they did shoot an innocent who had the misfortune to see them change their forms, one of the four people they directly killed during the mission (although at least one of them got better).

Those disguises got them to the council chambers and the Pseudopope's chambers. They arrived in time to eavesdrop on a conversation between the Pseudopope and the Weasel, with the latter making an angry claim that "the Angel will not stand for this", and storming out. The agent wearing the shape of the son had a brief conversation with the pseudopope, but before they could be rumbled, the pseudopope was called into the council chambers by an assistant.

While that had been happening, the other player had followed the Weasel to the Chapel of Storms, where the Weasel went inside. They regrouped, and detected various usual energies coming from the chapel. The Weasel didn't come out, so the players waited till nightfall, as stormclouds gathered in the sky.

When the players decided to move in, they decided to float in through the belltower, CREWs charged and ready to fire, with their disguises abandoned in favour of matt-black skeletal figures. They drifted silently in, noting the signs of extensive battle damage to the interior of the building. As they entered the main chapel, they discovered the Nariscene.

![The Nariscene, hanging beneath its encounter suit. It is a large purple orb with tentacles hanging beneath a glowing sphere](/assets/epilogue-nariscene.jpg)

Beneath the Nariscene, largely ignored, the Weasel was sitting in one of the pews, praying. The Nariscene seemed to be working on its encounter suit. The players watched for a few moments, and noticed remains of Armascott around the room.

They decided that they were not interested in negotiation, and shot the Weasel through the head with a CREW. The Nariscene pulled itself into its encounter suit, and a frantic gunfight began. The players won, but it wasn't one sided, and they were both sporting quite serious amounts of damage by the end.

And that, more or less, was that. They collected anything they thought was likely to provide useful intel, every intact part of Armascott, and some grisly trophies, and rigged one of the missiles to blow up.

We cut to the players floating several kilometres away as lightning struck the tower and blew it to bits.

We closed on the players being present when Otesa Oteo was being revived aboard the Paperclip Auditor, and faded out on Oteo complaining he'd put a lot of work into that body.

## Conclusions

Considering how adhoc the game was, I was really pleased with how it played out. Having a smaller number of players worked quite well, it meant everybody got their time to shine.

If I run a sequel, I'd be inclined to have new players do the more classic human/drone thing, and I'd definitely have Otesa Oteo make a reappearance. The players were quite keen to salvage Armascott's storage, and he's a fully backed up Contact drone, so a revival wouldn't be off the cards.
