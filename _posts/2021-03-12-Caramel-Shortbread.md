This is essentially three separate recipes, one after the other

For the base, you will need:

* 350g self-raising flour
* 250g unsalted butter
* 110g caster or granulated sugar

For the caramel filling, you will need:

* 250g caster or granulated sugar
* 250g unsalted butter
* 5 tablespoons golden syrup
* 370g Carnation Vegan Condensed Milk Alternative (or condensed milk, obviously)

For the topping, you will need:

* 50g butter
* 360g chocolate

### Implements


* Baking tray/tin (ideally a fairly large, fairly deep one, this recipe makes quite a lot of shortbread)
* A mixing implement (a wooden spoon)
* A saucepan
* A mixing bowl (arguably optional, you could use the saucepan)
* A set of scales

# Instructions

For simplicity's sake, it's probably best to make these sequentially.

# Making the base

* Preheat the oven to 180Â°C
* Rub flour, butter and caster sugar together until it resembles breadcrumbs.
* Press the mixture into the baking tin
* Bake for 20 minutes or until golden.

# Making the caramel

* Melt butter in a heavy based saucepan over a low heat
* Add sugar, golden syrup and condensed milk.
* Stir continuously for a ridiculously long time, on the order of 40 minutes or so.
* Once it is golden brown, test a drop in some cold water - it should form a firm drop when it's ready to use.
* Pour this mixture over the cooked base and let it cool.

# Making the topping

* Melt the chocolate and butter in a sauce pan over a low heat (be careful to avoid burning it)
* Pour over the caramel base, and allow to cool.
