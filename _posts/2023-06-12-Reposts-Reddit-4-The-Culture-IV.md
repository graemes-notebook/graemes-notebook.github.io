Special Circumstances are the Culture's ad-hoc intelligence agents. People's interest in them is understandable, because they're badass, but it's a lot like being into Star Trek for the space battles; no matter how cool it is, it's not what the series is fundamentally about.

## Just how physically and mentally capable are Special Circumstances agents?

Very capable. In addition to the neural lace and effector, Djan had energy weapons in her fingers and could secrete all kinds of interesting chemicals, if memory serves. I don't think we get a better rundown of what modifications a Culturnik Special Circumstances agent has than we get from Djan in Matter if that's what you're wondering. Not all people working for Special Circumstances fall into that highly enhanced role though -- for example Zakalwe in Use of Weapons works for them, and has only very low key augmentations by comparison (bio-immortality and some general survivability upgrades, I think).

> Would a lone SC agent be like a super hero, or just a badass black ops goon that can hear radio signals and hack computers with their brain?

Probably somewhere in between. But it's not how an SC agent works. They're not a hammer -- if the situation calls for one, there are a lot of more suitable alternatives available -- in the immediate short term, the SC drone buddy would be the one to provide the firepower, as per the opening of Matter.

## In Use of Weapons there's a bit where some men with swords break into a inn Diziet was staying in, she calls the Drone to defend her. Could she not have used her genofixed strength and reflexes to see them off herself?

Maybe.

I don't think there's any clear evidence that Diziet Sma is enhanced to the degree that somebody like Djan Seriy Anaplian is -- she may well be Culture normal, and it's pointed out a number of times in the books that Culturniks aren't engineered for martial prowess. Additionally, she may have altered her appearance (and possibly reduced her musculature) in order to blend in.

Even without that, the fact she can still gland drugs gives her a significant advantage -- we have a number of examples of glanded chemicals that significantly improve reaction time and deaden pain, even if there are no specific "berserker"-type options.

However, it's not her physical abilities which stop her being an effective combatant, it's her temperment. Diziet is not natural fighter, and she knows it. Every time she's in immediate physical danger, her first reaction is to call on her drone for support. When we see her in her element as an SC operative, she's at a social engagement, employing her charm and social skill to serve the Culture's interests.

In short, she's a manipulator, not a soldier, and fighting is what the drone is for.

## Why was the drone so extraordinarily violent, as opposed to, for example, rendering them all unconscious?

My best guess for why Skaffen-Amtiskaw handles the situation so violently is that, between having a rather sadistic disposition and having decided (somewhat legitimately) that the situation merited a show of force, it got so caught up using its abilities in the best possible way, and neglected to consider the larger impression it was giving.

We have some precedent to this -- the neatly choreographed obliteration of Vavatch by the Eschatologist in Consider Phlebas was horrifying to some onlookers for much the same reasons. And Falling Outside the Normal Moral Constraints took a great deal of pleasure from showcasing its martial prowess through acts of comprehensive violence.

_In general, the miltary drones and ships of the Culture exist in a balance between their intellectual and cultural aversions to violence, and their knowledge that their fundamental purpose is to be extremely good at it._

## Eglyle Parinherm, does anybody feel bad for him? And how does the Mistake Not... justify reading his mind and later killing him?

Possibly the Mistake Not... decided that finding out why elements of the Gzilt military were blowing each other up trumped the taboo against mind reading? Given Eglyle Parinherm's capabilities, the Mistake Not... probably wouldn't have wanted to risk reactivating it without getting some answers first.

It might have rationalised it on the grounds that Vyr and the old-guy-in-a-flashdrive have clearly actualised identities, while Parinherm, despite having the capability to be the same if allowed to develop, is essentially a blank slate as far as personhood is concerned. After all, while the Culture might recognise his right to an identity, the Gzilt treat him as a tool, to be given whatever persona and identity his mission requires.

While the Mistake Not... killing Parinherm is cold, under the circumstances, its options were limited. The Gzilt ship was already in the process of forming a displacement bubble around Parinherm's body, and the stakes were too high to take the risk that leaving his body to the Gzilt entailed.

But to answer the title question, yes, I feel bad for Eglyle Parinherm. He got a pretty raw deal through no fault of his own.

_One of the comments was: It does seem weird to me that the Culture are on friendly terms with a civ that practices (AI) slavery._

I know what you mean, but the Culture maintains diplomatic relations with far, far worse civilisations. Even if they didn't have the shared history that they have with the Gzilt, alienating them would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Obviously I'm wildly extrapolating here, but I imagine the situation with androids like Parinherm isn't really slavery in any sense we're familiar with. I imagine the 'core' AI that handles most of Parinherm's basic function is more like the combat arbites -- intelligent but utterly single-minded, to the point that it wouldn't make a distinction between a order that was valid and an order it consented to follow. Then any 'personality' that would be provided along with a mission would be layered on top of the core AI, so that even if the adopted personality seemed opposed to everything to do with the gzilt, it would still consent to the 'end mission' process (If you've seen Dollhouse, I'm imagining something a bit like the imprinted Actives in that).

If that's the case, while the Culture might not entirely approve, they'd probably not have a serious problem with it either. Ultimately they skirt a similar moral line with the more human ship avatars like Berdle, so there must be some way to reconcile intelligent-but-obedient androids with Culture morality, even if it's not readily obvious to us.

## How powerful are E-Dust assassins? What are their feats?

> How powerful are E-Dust assassins?

Very.

> What are their feats?

I assume you've read the sequence involving an E-Dust Assassin in Look to Windward?

Functionally they're comparable to a high-end combat drone or a particularly militaristic ship avatar, in much the same way that an Abominator-class GOU like Falling Outside the Normal Moral Constraints is comparable to a particularly advanced and militaristic GCV. That is to say, theoretically they possess the same kinds of abilities, but where the one is intended to be a general-purpose design mostly for 'friendly' interaction with some combat capabilties if they're needed, the other is a single-purpose weapon designed not only to kill their opponent but to break them so comprehensively that anybody who hears the outcome will immediately understand a simple, extremely important maxim:

Don't fuck with the Culture

_The post author replied: It seems like E-Dust assassins are the best choice for sending a strong, strong message, but do you think they'd be the equal of a combat drone or militaristic ship avatar? I'm sure they'd be more versatile, but I'm wondering if that could come at a sacrifice of component strength (effectors, dedicated weaponry, etc.)_

That's a good question. We only see E-Dust assassins in action against the Chelgarians, who aren't remotely equiv-tech, and probably wouldn't have been able to mount an effective defence even if they'd known what was coming for them.

My instinctive impression is that E-Dust assassins are anti-personnel weapons, to whatever extent that category exists in the culture arsenal. The more powerful effectors and dedicated weaponry we see are used for wide area control and hardened targets, which isn't generally required for the kind of mission the assassins are used for. In short, it would make a lot of sense to me if an E-Dust assassin didn't have the same effector strength or weaponry as a combat drone might.

A straight fight between an E-Dust construct and a ship avatar would be something I'd have loved to see Banks take on in the series, but I imagine it would probably boil down to the ship avatar having the means to flatten the E-Dust, but not being able to bring its full force to bear without doing excessive collateral damage in the process, while the E-Dust can shred the ship avatar if it can get close enough, but needs to exploit the terrain to do that. Probably leading to a confusing but intense sequence in which at least one reference is made to the Aliens franchise, probably along the lines of "They're coming outta the goddamn walls!"

_The funniest/most-worrying thing about E-Dust assassins is that despite how terrifying they are, they're on the primitive end of what SC is capable of, to the point that its very possible it actually came from the GFCF, who are effectively wannabe culture fanboys without really understanding the morality involved. A bit like the kind of people who ask endless VS questions about Culture weapons-tech..._
