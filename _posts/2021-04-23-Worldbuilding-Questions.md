A friend of mine is about to start a Dungeons and Dragons campaign set in a new campaign world. I was going to send her a massive list of questions about the setting, but then it got quite large, so I thought I'd write it up as a post instead, since they're questions I think are worth asking about most settings you're planning an RPG in, just so character general knowledge is established. I at least find it much easier to roleplay when I know about low level details of the setting.

Without further ado, I'll start on the questions:

## Chronology

1. What calendar do people use?
2. Is it similar to the gregorian calendar?
3. Does it track solar events (solar/lunar orbits and planetary rotations) or follow something else? (eg animal/tribal migrations, water cycles, weather patterns)
4. Are the years, months and days roughly the same duration as their earthly equivalents?
5. What is the current date?
6. Do years count up or down?
7. What's the significance of the epoch? (i.e. what happened in the year zero that made that year so important? Or if it counts down, what's going to happen when it reaches zero?)
8. Do days and months have the same names as in our world?

For my own games, I take the view that messing with months and days isn't worth the confusion it causes. I'm a big fan of changing the epoch though, as unless you're in a setting with Christian monks taking place after about 525 AD, there's absolutely no reason to use Anno Domini. A scythian monk called Dionysius Exiguus came up with the Anno Domini (Latin for 'the year of the lord') as an estimate for how long ago Jesus had lived, as part of a system for determining when Easter should be, and then it spread into common usage when it was adopted by Charlemagne and the Carolingian Empire. 

As something of an aside, it's also almost certainly inaccurate - Dionysius Exiguus extended the previous _anno Diocletiani_/_anno martyrum_ (Diocletian era/Era of the Martyrs) system, which counted based on the number of years since the last big Roman persecution of Christians under the rule of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (Dionysius Exiguus renamed it because he didn't want the name to reference Diocletian, somewhat understandably). The romans mainly used regnal years (the year of the reign of the current monarch) counting from the first election of the current pair of consuls (they were elected yearly during the republic, although it became a mess under the empire) - i.e. if Steve and Dave were made consul two years ago, the current year would be 2 _Steve et Dave consulibus_ ("Steve and Dave being consuls"). The problem with using regnal years is that to establish dates over any significant number of years requires you to have accurate and complete records of the reigns of all the intervening monarchs (or consuls in this case) which Dionysius Exiguus almost certainly didn't.

The romans also used _Ab urbe condita_ ("from the founding of the city"), mostly ceremonially, but it became more common for Renaissance publishers publishing older roman manuscripts to use it. The version of the dating system we know was created in the 1st century BC by Marcus Terentius Varro, based on the consuls list and was adopted by Emperor Claudius in the mid 1st century AD, because it was politically convenient for him to celebrate the city's 800th year, but there were a variety of calculations used before it. Because it was calculated about 750 years retroactively based on the consuls list, it has basically the same problems as _Anno Domini_, as the lists are incomplete, but there's no reason that would have to be the case for a fictional analogue.

The other common epoch for calendars is _Anno Mundi_ ("in the year of the world") basically the number of years since the creation of the world, which in the Byzantine and Hebrew calendars is ~6000 years ago. The fact that this date is wildly incorrect isn't a problem, calendar epochs are ultimately arbitrary. The main requirement is that it should be long enough ago that everything you need to deal with in normal life happened after it (regnal years are inconvenient in this respect) and that it's not so long ago that it's inconvenient to write - more than a single millennium digit is probably pointless, for example. As an example of an interesting modern epoch, unix time uses the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1st 1970, on the not unreasonable grounds that the first Unix Programmer's Manual came out in 1971, and 1970 seemed like a neat starting point.

There are some other interesting epochs out there for a date system, like greek Olympiads, the key is just that the system as a whole needs to have a start date that's widely understood, and ideally doesn't need to be reset too often. All in all though, it's a pretty painless way to add a bit of historical flavour to your setting background, so I highly recommend setting it somewhere interesting.

## Cosmology

1. What do most people think the world is?
    1. Is it a ball of rock orbiting a sun?
        1. How many moons does it have?
        2. How many suns does it have?
    2. Is it a disc carried on the back of four elephants standing on a turtle?
    3. Is it a giant ring?
    4. Is the dream of a mad god, that will cease to be when the dreamer awakens?
2. Are they right?
3. What do people who study the stars or make maps think? Do they agree with the consensus?
4. What do the priests of major religions think?
5. If the world is unlike our own, how does that affect seasons, timekeeping, etc?
6. Are there visible stars?
    1. What are they? Are they real stars?
    2. What do people think they are?
    3. Are there any significant constellations?

Whether or not the cosmos follows the general shape of the real world, unless space exploration is on the cards what's more likely to matter to the story is what people think it is. In most early civilisations, there are any number of interesting ideas about the nature of the world, but it's surprisingly easy for any civilisation with an awareness of geometry to work out the rough size and shape of it - on earth, the ancient greeks had calculations proving it, and the ancient phoenicians had practical observations supporting it.

In general, any civilisation with long distance travel (even if it's only coastal) will pretty quickly figure out the approximate shape of the world. Any civilisation that can reliably cross oceans needs to know the size and shape, even if they're navigating by the stars.

Speaking of the stars, most civilisations have pretty extensive myths around stars - sometimes they're identified with gods or heroes, sometimes they're holes in the shell of the world, sometimes they're just a really useful way to navigate, but whatever they are, you can bet that they matter to people.

# Divinity

1. Do gods exist?
2. Are they distinct from powerful magical creatures?
3. What is the relationship between gods and mortals?
4. Can mortals become gods?
5. Are there different, incompatible pantheons worshipped by different cultures, or have they merged into one pantheon that's part of the same overarching belief system?
6. Are gods powered by worship, or are they indifferent to it?
7. What gods are commonly worshipped in the area the game/story takes place?
8. Do gods have portfolios, and what does that mean in practice?
9. Are the gods active in the world of mortals?

The nature of divinity is an interesting and important thing to consider when creating a world. D&D bakes in a lot of assumptions about the nature of the gods that are not necessarily reflected in how the corresponding real world religions worked, and I think there's a lot to be gained from examining those assumptions. For what it's worth, there's no actual reason you couldn't run a game of D&D in a completely monotheistic setting, or even a completely atheistic one. 

That said, narratively the gods serve a valuable role as points on the moral compass for players who might otherwise be charitably described as "bloody-minded murderhobos" so keeping them is probably the better option. My perception is that the default portrayal of gods in classic high fantasy settings is that they're the apex predators of a spiritual ecosystem based around the harvesting and consumption of souls, which works for me. These gods are probably more narratively distant - you can't directly do much for or against them, (their assets in the mortal world are fair game, however) but your soul is going to end up in one of their digestive tracts (aka afterlives) so better make sure it's an afterlife you don't mind.

I also really like the Terry Pratchett take on Small Gods - that once created, gods never exactly die, but their power is very strongly drawn from the faith of their worshippers, although that faith needn't take the form of straight up worship. The latter point makes much room for gods that aren't necessarily desirable - things that you might believe in subconsciously, or gods that might have strangely specific domains. The best thing about these sorts of gods from a gameplay perspective is that they can be more directly interacted with by player actions - a player might convert a village to the worship of a neglected deity, earning themselves a boon from the freshly strengthened god, or take the fight to a hostile one by proselytising for a different faith in the towns of their worshippers.

# Theology

1. What major religions are there?
2. What do they believe?
3. Do they worship particular gods?
4. What sort of things do their acts of worship involve?
5. Do they have priests?
    1. Are the priests part of an organised clergy?
    2. Are the priests self/community-appointed?
    3. Do the priest have a uniform?
6. Are the religions organised?
7. How are the religions involved in government?
    1. Are there religious armed forces?
    2. Are there religious secret police/inquisitors?
    3. Is heresy or blasphemy a crime? (i.e. would you be punished by the legal system of the country)
    4. Is apostasy a crime?
8. How much power does the religion have culturally?
    1. How much of a problem will being seen as a non-believer be?
    2. Will the townsfolk mob a heretic or blasphemer?
9. Do the religions persecute any particular groups?
    1. Are particular species, races, sexes, etc subject to particular hatred?
    2. What's the theological reasoning behind it?
    3. Is it common?
    4. Does it often become violent?
10. Do the religions have any particular taboos?
    1. Do they have taboos against eating particular things?
    2. Do they have taboos against doing activities on particular days?
    3. Do they have taboos against wearing particular things?
    4. What's the theological reasoning behind it?
    5. What happens if you break the taboo?
11. Are there multiple major religions?
    1. Are they at war?
    2. Do they have territory?

Quite apart the actual gods, the religions of the world will likely directly impact on the story. Religious conflict is a wonderful plot driver, schisms can be a source of all kinds of interesting drama. If the local religions are closely integrated with the state, then priests likely wield legal power as well as social power. Even if they're not, the social power wielded by the priesthood should not be underestimated.

In general, I highly recommend any worldbuilder do a bit of research into how religions have worked in other times and places before jumping to the default 20th/21st century post-Reformation Christian model. In particular, it's important to remember that most people in history genuinely believed in their religions - living in mostly-secular modern Britain, it's easy to forget that for most of my ancestors, religion was a big deal, and not just as a cultural institution or some occasional traditions, but as an actual view of how the world worked.

In the divinity section I mentioned that D&D (and therefore most fantasy RPGs that followed it) baked in quite a few assumptions about the gods, and the same is true for how their followers relate to them. The form of religion implied by the core game mechanics is a kind of henotheistic polytheism, i.e. that a person worships a single god, but acknowledges that they're part of a pantheon. This is fairly unusual as polytheistic religions go, and I might be inclined to make uncharitable assumptions about why this is the default assumption in D&D. 

Most real religions exist somewhere on the spectrum of monotheism to pantheism. That is to say, some religions have a single god, some have several gods, and some have divinity in all things. As a result, the way that followers relate to their god varies wildly. Monotheistic religions are more likely cultivate the mindsets similar to Christianity or Islam, where the will of god is all, and as a mortal you either submit, or are punished for it, and end up obeying anyway. Personally, I think this a pretty miserable way to relate to your god, and it's even less fun as a gameplay mechanic.

Polytheistic religions are more interesting. In most polytheistic religions, particularly ones where gods have well understood portfolios of responsibility, devotion is both transient and transactional - that is to say, you pay devotion to the the god relevant to whatever you're setting out to do, and you're doing it explicitly on the basis that your devotion will bring their favour. Unlike classic D&D polytheism, you can't just ignore the gods you don't like - just because you're on really good terms with Nick, God of Walking In Clown Shoes doesn't mean you don't need to make offerings to Robbie, God of Identifying Mysterious Rashes when your problems are in his domain. This, incidentally, is why most polytheistic religions don't have many totally evil deities - you have to interact with even the gods of very unpleasant things, like plagues or famine, if only to ask them to stay away. And since you don't always have plagues or famines, they must be prepared to listen to you at enough to be brought off. My theory is that this is also why most Gods of the Dead are pretty chill compared to the rest of their pantheons: most of what the average worshipper wants from them is not to attract their attention, and to maybe stop great-uncle Herbert from coming back as a zombie and breaking out of the family tombs.

# Thaumaturgy

1. How does magic work in this setting?
2. Can magic be learned by anybody or does it require natural talent?
3. Is there a fundamental difference between arcane magic and divine magic?
4. Is magic a natural part of the world?
5. Are spells a fundamental part of magic, or just a convenience?
    1. Are they the limit of what a magic user can do, or just what they can do predictably in the field?
6. Are spells an in-universe concept?
7. Are spell levels an in-universe concept?
8. How are different kinds of magic practitioners seen?
    1. Are wizards respected?
    2. Are they feared?
    3. Are witches a distinct thing?
    4. Are sorcerers?
9. Are magic users common or rare?
    6. What social status do they have?
    7. Would a royal court expect to have a dedicated mage?
    8. Would a town expect to have a local mage?
    9. How many magic users would you expect to find in a city?
9. How is using magic in public seen?
    1. Is it legal?
    2. Is it treated like handling fireworks?
    3. Is it regarded the same as drawing a gun?
10. How often does a normal person see magic used?
11. How common are magical items?
12. Can normal magic users make magical items?

I don't have much to add to these questions, they're basically all "how does magic fit into the world". I really like the idea of spell levels as an in-universe concept though. It always seems logical to me that in a setting with professional magic users, a system for classifying the relative power and complexity of spells would emerge, and probably be fairly consistent across cultures.

# Geography

1. What are the countries most relevant to the events of the story?
2. Which one does it take place in?
3. What system of government does it use?
    1. Is it a monarchy?
    2. Is it some form of republic?
    3. Is there some sort of senate or parliament?
    4. Are there feudal aristocrats?
    5. Are there elections?
4. What is its relationship with the surrounding countries like?
    1. Are they connected by trade alliances?
    2. Do they have related political dynasties?
    3. Have they fought a war in living memory?
    4. Are there historical alliances?
5. How interconnected are the countries for trade?
    1. What are each country's major imports and exports?
    2. What trade routes are important for them?
6. Do they have porous borders or are they tightly controlled?
7. Which nations are considered enemies?
8. Which nations are considered allies or neutral?
9. How independent are the towns in the home nation?
10. How are the towns and cities ruled?
11. What sort of policing is there?
    1. Is there a professional police force?
    2. Who the law enforced on behalf of?

Designing interesting and plausible geopolitics could easily be an entire series of posts in itself, and people far more knowledgable than I have probably already written them, so I don't have much to add here either.

    1. In chemistry? (e.g electroplating, possibly known to the parthians)
    2. In medicine? (quack or otherwise)
    3. As weaponry?
7. Are there any long distance forms of communication?
    1. Are they entirely magical?
    2. Do they use cables, e.g. a telegraph?
    3. Do they use line-of-sight signalling? (e.g. semaphore towers)
    4. Do they use couriers?
    5. Do they use animals?

    2. Do they use magical imps who can count really well and fit in a pocket watch?

Fantasy is often very careful to avoid being steampunk, or else gleefully dives headfirst into it, which means that the presence of technology is often very binary - either anything that looks like technology is completely avoided, or everything is technology even when it makes no sense. I'd like to present a case for moderation - in the real world, early forms of steam power and firearms appeared far earlier than the traditional "high medieval" base fantasy that D&D tends to assume, and steampunk tends to ignore a lot of the limiting factors on the advanced forms of them that couldn't be overcome until far more recently.

In particular, I'd like to make the case for static steam engines in a general fantasy world being a important technology in justifying deep delving in dwarven mines - a static engine as a pump can pump air in and water out of caves, allowing for more sophisticated tunnelling, and magical flame makes it much more viable as an underground, continuous operation device. This doesn't have to enable railways if it doesn't fit the setting - a railway requires serious infrastructure, and making a steam engine that can be moved and is powerful enough to move itself and a train is much, much more complicated.

Likewise, surprisingly advanced firearms were possible and made in very limited numbers a remarkably long time before bows left the battlefield, the limiting factor was always what could be made on a larger scale without requiring hundreds of hours of time from skilled artisans, and what the logistics of producing ammunition and powder permitted.

I'm expecting to have more worldbuilding questions, but for the sake of having something posted this week, I shall leave it for a follow-up post.
