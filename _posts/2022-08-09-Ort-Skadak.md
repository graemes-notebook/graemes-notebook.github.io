# Gilbert's Guide to the Galaxy Volume 7: Species of the Troy Cluster

## Entry 901: The Ort Skadak

One of the the stranger species in the Troy cluster calls themselves the Ort Skadak. At first glance, the average Ort Skadak tends to put in mind the image of a five foot tall flying ant. On closer inspection, the impression doesn't hold up — Ort Skadak are six-limbed bipeds, with hexdactyl hands and feet, and bat-like wings, which function as a second pair of arms. They have no antennae or mandibles – their jaws are functionally similar to mammals, with teeth and tongue analogues.

They have a thick outer skin which is sometimes incorrectly labelled an exoskeleton, and widely-spaced bulbous eyes. Ort Skadak prefer cool, dark environments, have poor colour vision but excellent night vision, and have slightly less sensitive hearing than the human norm.

The home system of the Ort Skadak shares the same name, consisting of the K-type main-sequence star Ort, two gas giants, a number of uninhabitable barren worlds, and two dense asteroid belts. The asteroid belts are where the vast majority of Ort Skadak may be found. Within these asteroid belts are large space stations, which the Ort Skadak call hiveworlds. These are generally constructed from the wreckage of other ships, hollowed out segments of asteroids, and other crudely built structures. There are thousands of hiveworlds in the system, most with populations in the hundreds of millions. Most estimates of the population of Ort Skadak produce numbers in the single digit trillions.

Life in a Ort Skadak Hiveworld is deeply unpleasant by most standards. The average citizen of a hiveworld has no formal education, no access to Galactic Basic translation, has no access to outside media in any case, and exists in a work-eat-sleep cycle that the most tyrannical industrialists on earth can only dream of imposing on their workers. A worker in the hive spends their every waking moment in service to it, and for the most part, is barely even aware the wider galaxy exists. There is no central Ort Skadak government above the level of the hive, and very little communication between them.

The government within a hive is is fundamentally tied to the Ort Skadak reproductive cycle - at the highest level, a body whose name directly translates as "Council of Crones". Membership of this group is limited to older female Ort Skadak, and members of this body are called "Revered Mothers". There are normally a few thousand Revered Mothers in a hiveworld. Beneath them are "Blessed Mothers" - egg-laying female Ort Skadak. Transition from Blessed Mothers to Revered Mothers occurs when the Blessed Mother passes into the infertile stage of their lifecycle at around twenty standard years. Ort Skadak mortality drastically increases at this age, worker male and female Ort Skadak, rarely live beyond their early twenties, but Mothers who survive their transition to Revered Mother usually live to see their centenary, making them an important stabilising influence.

An important component in understanding Ort Skadak behaviour is that Ort Skadak in their own colonies have no concept of personal property – things are communally owned by the hive. They have no word for theft, the closest equivalent means something like ‘greedy’ or ‘hides things so nobody else can use them’ and calling somebody it is a surefire way to start a fight. This tends to bring them into conflict with other groups who do understand personal property. Ort Skadak often acquire reputations as thieves, sometimes justifiably. Individual Ort Skadak who spend time with other cultures usually reach an understanding of the concept quickly, and navigate their way to a compatible worldview that lets them function in society. Larger groups sometimes struggle with this process, and decide ‘may as well hang for a sheep as a lamb’ and fully embrace piracy and raiding instead.

The Ort Skadak association with piracy is not helped by the ease with which pirates of other species can find sanctuary in the system - the lack of central government and density of space habitats means that it is easy for a wanted vessel to disappear into the chaos, and the hive leadership are unlikely to provide any assistance to pursuers.

Such ships passing through provide the main route of egress for a steady trickle of wanderers, exiles and drifters seeking a life outside their hiveworld - finding stowaways is a common occurrence after docking with a hiveworld
