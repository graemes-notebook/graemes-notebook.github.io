* 400g Bournville chocolate
* 370g Carnation Vegan Condensed Milk Alternative
* 25g Morrisons Plant butter
* 175g icing sugar
* A splash of vanilla (optional)


# Implements


* Baking tray/tin (the one I have is about A4-sized, and about a centimetre deep)
* Baking/greaseproof paper
* A sieve (technically optional, and slightly less messy if you don't use it, but the consistency of the fudge suffers without it)
* A mixing implement (a wooden spoon does the job nicely, an electric whisk would be less effort)
* A saucepan
* A sharp knife or a pizza cutter
* A set of scales

# Instructions

* Break or chop the chocolate into small chunks.

* Melt the chocolate in a non-stick saucepan on a low heat - the lower the better. It's very easy to end up burning the chocolate, which tastes unpleasant.

* Add the condensed milk and butter.

* Melt the ingredients together, stirring frequently until smooth and silky. In my experience the plant replacements burn rather than caramelizes when overheated, so staying on a low heat is recommended.

* Sieve in the icing sugar and mix thoroughly (you can use an electric whisk if you like, although I use a wooden spoon).

* Pour fudge into a tin that has been lined with baking paper.

* Chill in the fridge for until set, then cut into squares. You can do this using a sharp knife, although you'll find it much easier using a pizza cutter. As a bonus, this will produce crisper edges.

# Notes

This is basically the same recipe as my other chocolate fudge recipe converted to use entirely vegan ingredients. For my money, it generally produces a better result than the non-vegan recipe - between the plant butter and the condensed milk replacement, the resulting mixture has a texture closer to butter fudge, and that sets much better than the condensed milk version usually does.

The tradeoff is that the mixture doesn't become as liquid, and has to be actively spread into the tray. The resulting fudge will consequently have a less even surface texture, although this is not necessarily a negative. Note that the baking paper doesn't require dusting to ensure a smooth release - once set the vegan fudge is less sticky than the original mix.
